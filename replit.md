## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Technology Stack**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite, Wouter for routing, TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui for styling, Tanstack Query for server state management, React Hook Form for form validation, Framer Motion for animations.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: The design prioritizes a clean, professional aesthetic with consistent white cards, subtle gray borders, and a cohesive typography hierarchy. It uses subtle color accents and avoids bright, game-like schemes. The platform emphasizes mobile-first responsiveness and a unified component architecture. Recent enhancements include a consistent blue-to-purple gradient theme across various elements (buttons, navigation tabs, tier badges) and an interactive phone preview system on the landing page. The Leaderboard UI is redesigned to match the professional aesthetic of the Overview tab.

### Backend
