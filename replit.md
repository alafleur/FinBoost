## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Technology Stack**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite, Wouter for routing, TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui for styling, Tanstack Query for server state management, React Hook Form for form validation, Framer Motion for animations.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: The design prioritizes a clean, professional aesthetic with consistent white cards, subtle gray borders, and a cohesive typography hierarchy. It uses subtle color accents and avoids bright, game-like schemes. The platform emphasizes mobile-first responsiveness and a unified component architecture. Recent enhancements include a consistent blue-to-purple gradient theme across various elements (buttons, navigation tabs, tier badges) and an interactive phone preview system on the landing page. The Leaderboard UI is redesigned to match the professional aesthetic of the Overview tab.

### Backend
- **Technology Stack**: Express.js with TypeScript, PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM, JWT for authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, Multer for file upload handling.
- **Core Features**:
    - **Authentication System**: Supports email/password, Google OAuth, password reset, and role-based access control.
    - **Points and Rewards System**: Configurable actions, proof-based awards, percentile-based tier system, monthly reward pool distribution, and a referral system. It supports cycle-based rewards and a minimum pool guarantee.
    - **Learning Management**: Offers rich content modules, interactive quizzes, progress tracking, and manages free/premium content access.
    - **Payment Processing**: Handles subscription management and reward disbursements, including a robust PayPal disbursement system with two-phase transactions, idempotency, retry logic, comprehensive error handling, and advanced batch chunking optimization with 500-recipient chunks for enhanced API reliability.
    - **Admin Portal**: Provides tools for content management, user/analytics management, points configuration, flexible winner selection (point-weighted random, top performers, pure random, manual), configurable tier pools, individual payout adjustments, and Excel export/import for winner data.
    - **Prediction System**: Implements skill-based prediction questions with configurable points, deadline management, results determination, and nuanced scoring.
