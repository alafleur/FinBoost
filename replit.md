## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Technology Stack**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite, Wouter for routing, TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui for styling, Tanstack Query for server state management, React Hook Form for form validation, Framer Motion for animations.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Prioritizes a clean, professional aesthetic with consistent white cards, subtle gray borders, and a cohesive typography hierarchy. Subtle color accents (e.g., stats cards, tier stats) are used while avoiding bright, game-like schemes. The design emphasizes mobile-first responsiveness and unified component architecture across all screen sizes. Recent enhancements include a unified blue→purple gradient theme for consistency across landing page and dashboard elements (buttons, navigation tabs, tier badges) and an interactive phone preview system on the landing page. The Leaderboard UI has also been redesigned for a professional look, matching the Overview tab's aesthetic.
