**Development Standards:**
- NO SHORTCUTS EVER - Always implement complete, production-ready solutions
- Never use placeholders or temporary fixes in production code
- Use realistic test data when needed for testing, but never fake data in production features
- Always trace issues to root cause rather than applying surface-level patches
- Verify every fix with actual testing and data validation
- Document exact changes made for transparency and accountability
- Use systematic debugging approach - identify, isolate, fix, verify
