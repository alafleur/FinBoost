Eliminates scaling complexity while providing clearer tier information to users.
- June 14, 2025. **COMPLETED PHASE 2: Cycle-Based System Implementation** - Successfully implemented comprehensive cycle-based architecture alongside existing monthly system. Added 5 new database tables (cycle_settings, user_cycle_points, cycle_winner_selections, cycle_point_history, cycle_points_actions) with full CRUD operations. Implemented 27 new storage methods and 15 new API endpoints for flexible cycle management (weekly/bi-weekly/custom), configurable tier thresholds, mid-cycle joining logic, winner selection algorithms, and points tracking. Phase 2 maintains existing monthly functionality while enabling shorter reward cycles essential for engagement and product-market fit testing.
- June 14, 2025. **COMPLETED COMPREHENSIVE CYCLE-BASED MIGRATION** - Successfully migrated entire platform from monthly to cycle-based terminology and functionality. Completed all 4 phases: Phase 1 (Admin Portal migration), Phase 2 (UX improvements), Phase 3 (Dashboard migration), and Phase 4 (Terminology consistency). Updated all shared components (PointsSummary, RewardsHistory, Leaderboard, CommunityGrowthDial), dashboard data fetching, marketing copy, and UI elements. Platform now consistently uses "cycle" terminology throughout with complete mobile-desktop consistency. All database operations migrated to cycle endpoints while maintaining backward compatibility.
- June 14, 2025. **FIXED CRITICAL DASHBOARD MODULES BUG** - Resolved "4 of 0 completed" learning modules display issue. Root cause was unnecessary filtering of published modules by non-existent `isPublished` property, causing all 8 fetched modules to be filtered out. Fixed module fetch timing and removed erroneous filter. Dashboard now correctly displays "4 of 8 completed" with proper lesson progress tracking.
- June 14, 2025. **COMPLETED SYSTEM CONSOLIDATION** - Successfully consolidated monthly and cycle-based architectures into unified cycle system. Migrated historical data (192 winner selections, 6 cycles, 1 active setting) safely to preserve business logic. Updated all storage methods, API endpoints (/api/admin/monthly-pool-settings → /api/admin/cycle-settings), and database references. Eliminated redundant code while maintaining full backward compatibility. Platform now operates on single cycle-based architecture supporting all timeframes.
- June 15, 2025. **RESOLVED CRITICAL ANALYTICS DISPLAY BUG** - Fixed "0 participants" and "$0.00 pool" display issue in admin analytics dashboard. Root cause was database schema mismatch (cycleId vs cycle_setting_id) and missing premium subscriber enrollment. Implemented auto-enrollment script that successfully enrolled all 72 premium subscribers into active reward cycle. Fixed currency conversion error (cents to dollars) in pool calculation and implemented cache-busting for real-time data display. Updated cycle naming to simple date-based format ("Dec 1 - Dec 31, 2025") for clarity and simplicity. Analytics now correctly displays "72 participants" and "$396.00 pool" reflecting actual subscriber base and proper reward pool calculation.
- June 15, 2025. **AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM FIXED** - Resolved JWT token mismatch causing 401 errors and blank admin analytics. Fixed inconsistency between login token generation (JWT) and authentication verification (old token system). Updated getUserById method to query database directly instead of in-memory storage. Admin user profile and rights preserved. Current Cycle analytics still showing blank due to complex database query errors - deferred for future optimization.
- June 16, 2025. **NAVIGATION BUG FIXED** - Resolved non-functional "Sign Up for Free" button in navbar. Button was attempting to scroll to non-existent waitlist form element. Updated to properly navigate to `/auth?mode=signup` using wouter routing, matching behavior of other CTA buttons throughout the application.
- June 17, 2025. **CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM UNIFIED** - Fixed major authentication inconsistencies causing lesson completion failures and premium module access issues. Root cause was mixed token systems: JWT tokens for login (working) vs in-memory tokens for endpoints (failing after server restarts). Unified all authentication endpoints to use consistent JWT validation. Fixed parameter order mismatch in points awarding causing SQL errors. Authentication now works reliably across all platform features including lesson completion, user progress, premium access, and points system.
- June 17, 2025. **LESSON COMPLETION MESSAGING FIXED** - Resolved points display inconsistency where lesson completion screen showed conflicting point values (20 points at top vs "10+15=25" breakdown at bottom). Updated lesson completion component to use actual points earned from API response instead of hardcoded values. Now displays accurate total points awarded with optional streak bonus breakdown, eliminating user confusion about point calculations.
- June 17, 2025. **CYCLE POINTS TRACKING SYNCHRONIZED** - Fixed critical disconnect between lesson completion system and cycle points tracking. Root cause was markLessonComplete() only updating monthly points but not cycle points, causing "This Cycle" to show 0 despite earned points. Updated lesson completion to sync both monthly and cycle point systems simultaneously. Manually synchronized existing user points to cycle tracker. Dashboard now accurately displays current cycle progress.
- June 17, 2025. **ADMIN UI TERMINOLOGY MIGRATION COMPLETED** - Successfully completed Phase 1 frontend terminology updates to align admin interface with dynamic cycle backend capabilities. Updated all variable names (monthlyPoolSettings → cyclePoolSettings), API endpoints (/api/admin/monthly-pool-settings → /api/admin/cycle-settings), tab titles, dialog descriptions, and error messages. Removed hardcoded "$20 subscription" and "monthly cycle" references. Admin interface now properly reflects support for weekly/bi-weekly/custom duration cycles with configurable parameters.
- June 17, 2025. **USER UI PROFILE TERMINOLOGY MIGRATION COMPLETED** - Successfully completed Phase 1 user interface terminology updates for Profile page. Updated UserProfile interface (currentMonthPoints → currentCyclePoints), display text ("This Month" → "This Cycle"), tier progress calculations, and all point references to use cycle-based terminology. Profile page now consistently aligns with dynamic cycle backend system supporting configurable weekly/bi-weekly/custom duration cycles.
- June 17, 2025. **COMPLETE USER UI TERMINOLOGY MIGRATION FINISHED** - Successfully completed all 3 phases of user interface terminology updates. Phase 1 (Profile page), Phase 2 (Admin user-facing cards and UpgradePrompt component), and Phase 3 (Dashboard_backup.tsx) all updated from "monthly" to "cycle" terminology. Updated currentMonthPoints → currentCyclePoints throughout interfaces, changed "This Month" → "This Cycle" displays, and fixed component parameter passing. User interface now consistently matches dynamic cycle backend supporting weekly/bi-weekly/custom durations.
- June 18, 2025. **PAGINATION SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented complete pagination system for leaderboard component supporting 72+ users. Step 4.1: Backend pagination with getCycleLeaderboardPaginated() method accepting page/pageSize parameters. Step 4.2: Frontend pagination logic handling paginated API responses with working Previous/Next navigation. Step 4.3: Responsive mobile UI optimization with "Prev/Next" compact buttons and stacked layout for mobile, "Previous/Next" inline layout for desktop. Single component architecture maintained across all screen sizes. System displays 72 users across 4 pages of 20 users each with accurate rank calculations.
- June 18, 2025. **CRITICAL JWT AUTHENTICATION BUG FIXED** - Resolved authentication issue where new user registrations received malformed tokens causing "jwt malformed" errors when accessing lessons. Root cause was registration endpoint using storage.generateToken() (random hex strings) while login used proper jwt.sign(). Updated registration endpoint to use identical JWT generation as login with consistent secret key and 24h expiration. New users now receive valid JWT tokens immediately upon registration and can access lessons without authentication errors.
- June 18, 2025. **ENHANCED CYCLE STATISTICS DISPLAY COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented comprehensive cycle stats enhancement in "Strength in Numbers" section. Added tier-specific pool breakdown with dedicated colored boxes (Tier 1: $198, Tier 2: $118, Tier 3: $79) and prominent cycle countdown display showing days remaining with formatted end date ("December 31, 2025"). Backend APIs enhanced to provide dynamic tier calculations (50%/30%/20% split) and formatted cycle end dates. Frontend component restructured with proper visual hierarchy: tier boxes in separate 3-column row, cycle countdown in dedicated box alongside member count. Single component architecture maintained for mobile/desktop consistency.
- June 18, 2025. **CYCLE DISPLAY CONSISTENCY FIXED** - Resolved tier box coloring inconsistency by implementing unified green color scheme with proper prominence hierarchy (Tier 1 darkest to Tier 3 lightest). Fixed missing cycle countdown on desktop by adding distributionInfo parameter to desktop CommunityGrowthDial call, ensuring identical single component behavior across all screen sizes. Desktop and mobile now display identical cycle statistics including "195 Days to Cycle End" countdown.
- June 18, 2025. **MOBILE CONTINUE LEARNING BUTTON FIXED** - Resolved mobile formatting issue where "Continue Learning" button was misaligned and positioned outside card boundaries. Implemented responsive flex layout that stacks content vertically on mobile with full-width button, while maintaining horizontal layout on desktop. Button now displays properly within card constraints on all screen sizes.
- June 18, 2025. **DYNAMIC REWARD POOL PERCENTAGE SYNC COMPLETED** - Successfully synchronized reward pool percentage display between admin portal settings and user dashboard visualization. Modified `/api/cycles/pool` endpoint to return actual `rewardPoolPercentage` (55%) from admin configuration instead of hardcoded values. Updated CommunityGrowthDial component interface and logic to use dynamic API value with 50% fallback. Donut chart and "Rewards Allocation" stats now correctly display the admin-configured percentage, ensuring consistency between backend calculations and frontend visualization.
- June 18, 2025. **TIER THRESHOLDS SYSTEM COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented dynamic tier thresholds display in user dashboard. Added `/api/cycles/current/tier-thresholds` endpoint returning real-time tier boundaries from admin settings. Created TierStats component with proper tier logic ensuring Tier 1 (67+ points) is highest, Tier 2 (33-66 points) is middle, and Tier 3 (0-32 points) is lowest. Fixed API response handling and implemented fallback values for reliability. Removed duplicate tier displays to maintain single component architecture across mobile and desktop. Dashboard now displays accurate tier progression with user's current tier highlighted using compact 3-column card layout.
- June 18, 2025. **TIER CALCULATION SYSTEM FIXED** - Resolved critical tier assignment bug where percentile calculations were backwards. Fixed tier threshold logic to properly assign tier1 to top 33% performers (highest points), tier2 to middle 33%, and tier3 to bottom 33%. Updated calculateUserTier() method to use correct database column (currentMonthPoints) instead of non-existent currentCyclePoints. Executed comprehensive SQL recalculation updating all 72 active users with correct tier assignments based on performance percentiles. System now properly reflects relative standing within community rather than arbitrary point thresholds.
- June 18, 2025. **COMPREHENSIVE TIER DATA SOURCE CORRECTION** - Fixed fundamental data source issue where tier calculations used outdated currentMonthPoints instead of actual current cycle points. Updated calculateUserTier() and getCycleTierThresholds() methods to query user_cycle_points table for authentic current cycle data. Modified /api/auth/me endpoint to fetch real cycle points via getUserCyclePoints(). Executed system-wide tier recalculation for all 72 users using actual cycle points data, ensuring tier assignments reflect genuine current cycle performance rather than stale monthly data.
- June 18, 2025. **TIER CALCULATION LOGIC SIMPLIFIED** - Replaced complex percentile calculations with clean, logical structure: 0 points = tier3 (no engagement), active users with points compete only against each other using admin-configured 33/67 percentile thresholds. Eliminates edge case where having any points automatically grants tier1. Creates proper separation between non-engaged users and active performers competing fairly based on relative performance levels.
- June 18, 2025. **TIER DISPLAY CONSISTENCY FIXED** - Fixed leaderboard and admin dashboard tier display inconsistencies by correcting data source mapping. Updated getCycleLeaderboard and getCycleLeaderboardPaginated methods to use users.tier instead of non-existent userCyclePoints.tier column. Tier calculations now properly map to all display components (leaderboard, admin dashboard, user profiles) ensuring consistent tier representation across the entire platform. Top performers now correctly show as Tier 1/2 instead of incorrectly displaying Tier 3.
- June 18, 2025. **DASHBOARD CYCLE POINTS DISPLAY FIXED** - Resolved critical inconsistency where dashboard showed "0 current pts but tier 2" by fixing /api/auth/me endpoint. Root cause was getUserCyclePoints() method being called with only userId parameter but requiring both userId and cycleSettingId. Updated endpoint to first fetch active cycle setting, then retrieve user's cycle points for that cycle. Dashboard now correctly displays actual cycle points (40) matching tier assignment instead of showing 0 points.
- July 2, 2025. **DYNAMIC PERCENTILE CALCULATION SYSTEM COMPLETED** - Successfully fixed the dynamic percentile-based tier threshold calculation engine that was returning static fallback values instead of real-time calculations. Root cause was the calculateDynamicTierThresholds method filtering out users with 0 points from the enrolled user base, then returning static values when no users had points. Fixed logic to properly handle users with 0 points (who automatically get Tier 3) while calculating percentiles from users with points > 0. Added realistic test point distribution to 72 enrolled users for testing. System now correctly returns dynamic thresholds (e.g., Tier 1: 61+, Tier 2: 28-60, Tier 3: 0-27) based on actual user performance distribution using configured 33%/67% percentiles. Eliminates static fallback dependency and ensures tier assignments reflect genuine relative performance within the community.
- July 10, 2025. **CYCLE COMPLETION SYSTEM FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - Successfully implemented comprehensive cycle completion architecture with clean slate point reset approach. Added database schema (status, completedAt, completedBy fields), storage methods (completeCycle, archiveCycleData), API endpoints (/api/admin/cycles/:id/complete, /api/admin/cycles/:id/archive), and admin UI with "Complete Cycle" button. System provides clean competition reset where all user points reset to 0 between cycles while preserving complete historical data. Includes admin confirmation dialogs, status tracking (active/completed/archived), and proper authentication. Tested end-to-end with successful cycle creation, completion, verification, and cleanup. Addresses all ChatGPT integration suggestions with more sophisticated existing capabilities including dynamic percentile-based tiers vs fixed thresholds.

All 12 API endpoints functional with proper authentication. System supports skill-based prediction questions with configurable point awards, deadline management, and result determination. Database integrity constraints prevent deletion of questions with user predictions, ensuring historical data preservation. Prediction system fully operational with comprehensive admin management and engaging user experience. Complete points distribution workflow: admin determines correct answer → admin sets custom points per option → points distributed based on admin allocation → proper validation prevents duplicate distribution. Integration testing confirms all features working correctly end-to-end.
- July 10, 2025. **CORRECTED WORKFLOW FULLY OPERATIONAL** - Successfully completed frontend cleanup by removing all pointAwards references from question creation interface and confirmed corrected workflow through comprehensive testing. System now properly implements the intended workflow: 1) Admin creates question with options only (no point allocation), 2) Admin publishes question, 3) Users submit predictions, 4) Real event occurs, 5) Admin determines result AND allocates custom points per option enabling nuanced scoring, 6) System distributes points based on admin allocation. Test demonstrates S&P 500 range predictions where exact range gets 20 points, close ranges get 5/10 points, far ranges get 0 points. Complete separation of question creation and point allocation enables sophisticated post-result scoring logic with full admin control over point distribution fairness.
- July 12, 2025. **LANDING PAGE V2 COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented comprehensive new landing page architecture with 8 modern, mobile-first components accessible at `/v2` route. Created HeroV2, SharedStruggleV2, HowItWorksV2, TransparentEconomicsV2, EarlyAccessV2, HighWinRatesV2, BiggerPurposeV2, and FinalCTAV2 components.
