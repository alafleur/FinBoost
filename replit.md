## Changelog
- June 13, 2025. Initial setup
- June 13, 2025. Added Profile tab to mobile navigation with comprehensive subscription payment details display including amount, payment method, dates, and PayPal configuration for reward disbursements. Implemented admin endpoints for managing user payment information with automatic next billing date calculation (last day of month).
- June 13, 2025. Session interrupted during desktop dashboard restoration work. Missing components identified include: LeaderboardSidebar positioning, community growth metrics, proper tier system (Tier 1/2/3), and complete desktop layout structure. Work in progress to restore full desktop dashboard functionality.
- June 14, 2025. Completed desktop dashboard migration to 5-tab structure matching mobile exactly (Overview, Learn, Referrals, Rewards, Board). Removed Profile tab from navigation (functionality remains in header). Fixed Board tab leaderboard to show all members with pagination instead of 20-user limit. Implemented complete Overview tab with all mobile content including stats grid, community growth dial, learning modules preview, and rewards history. Desktop now has full consistency with mobile interface.
- June 14, 2025. Fixed three critical desktop dashboard issues: 1) Corrected tier naming system to display "Tier 1/2/3" instead of outdated "Bronze" terminology on both mobile and desktop, 2) Unified color schemes between platforms using mobile's preferred warm orange/yellow palette, 3) Optimized desktop layout with efficient 2x2 stats grid plus sidebar Community Growth component, eliminating excessive whitespace and improving space utilization.
- June 14, 2025. Achieved complete mobile-desktop consistency by implementing identical 4-stat layout (Current Tier, Total Points, This Month, Lessons) with matching orange/yellow color schemes on both platforms. Replaced generic dollar sign icon with actual FinBoost brand logo featuring blue design with upward trending arrows. Dashboard now displays identical information and branding across all device sizes.
- June 14, 2025. Completed full mobile-desktop consistency project by implementing identical profile functionality across platforms. Desktop now features the same interactive PayPal payment configuration, subscription details, and account information as mobile. Added admin portal access button to header for authorized users. Achieved complete code unification with single source of truth for all dashboard features, eliminating platform-specific inconsistencies and reducing maintenance overhead.
- June 14, 2025. Implemented tier progress table component replacing complex progress bar visualization. Shows clear tier boundaries (Tier 3: 0-20, Tier 2: 21-55, Tier 1: 56+) with user's current tier highlighted. Uses identical component code for mobile and desktop with consistent messaging format. Eliminates scaling complexity while providing clearer tier information to users.
- June 14, 2025. **COMPLETED PHASE 2: Cycle-Based System Implementation** - Successfully implemented comprehensive cycle-based architecture alongside existing monthly system. Added 5 new database tables (cycle_settings, user_cycle_points, cycle_winner_selections, cycle_point_history, cycle_points_actions) with full CRUD operations. Implemented 27 new storage methods and 15 new API endpoints for flexible cycle management (weekly/bi-weekly/custom), configurable tier thresholds, mid-cycle joining logic, winner selection algorithms, and points tracking. Phase 2 maintains existing monthly functionality while enabling shorter reward cycles essential for engagement and product-market fit testing.
- June 14, 2025. **COMPLETED COMPREHENSIVE CYCLE-BASED MIGRATION** - Successfully migrated entire platform from monthly to cycle-based terminology and functionality. Completed all 4 phases: Phase 1 (Admin Portal migration), Phase 2 (UX improvements), Phase 3 (Dashboard migration), and Phase 4 (Terminology consistency). Updated all shared components (PointsSummary, RewardsHistory, Leaderboard, CommunityGrowthDial), dashboard data fetching, marketing copy, and UI elements. Platform now consistently uses "cycle" terminology throughout with complete mobile-desktop consistency. All database operations migrated to cycle endpoints while maintaining backward compatibility.
- June 14, 2025. **FIXED CRITICAL DASHBOARD MODULES BUG** - Resolved "4 of 0 completed" learning modules display issue. Root cause was unnecessary filtering of published modules by non-existent `isPublished` property, causing all 8 fetched modules to be filtered out. Fixed module fetch timing and removed erroneous filter. Dashboard now correctly displays "4 of 8 completed" with proper lesson progress tracking.
- June 14, 2025. **COMPLETED SYSTEM CONSOLIDATION** - Successfully consolidated monthly and cycle-based architectures into unified cycle system. Migrated historical data (192 winner selections, 6 cycles, 1 active setting) safely to preserve business logic. Updated all storage methods, API endpoints (/api/admin/monthly-pool-settings → /api/admin/cycle-settings), and database references. Eliminated redundant code while maintaining full backward compatibility. Platform now operates on single cycle-based architecture supporting all timeframes.
- June 15, 2025. **RESOLVED CRITICAL ANALYTICS DISPLAY BUG** - Fixed "0 participants" and "$0.00 pool" display issue in admin analytics dashboard. Root cause was database schema mismatch (cycleId vs cycle_setting_id) and missing premium subscriber enrollment. Implemented auto-enrollment script that successfully enrolled all 72 premium subscribers into active reward cycle. Fixed currency conversion error (cents to dollars) in pool calculation and implemented cache-busting for real-time data display. Updated cycle naming to simple date-based format ("Dec 1 - Dec 31, 2025") for clarity and simplicity. Analytics now correctly displays "72 participants" and "$396.00 pool" reflecting actual subscriber base and proper reward pool calculation.
- June 15, 2025. **AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM FIXED** - Resolved JWT token mismatch causing 401 errors and blank admin analytics. Fixed inconsistency between login token generation (JWT) and authentication verification (old token system). Updated getUserById method to query database directly instead of in-memory storage. Admin user profile and rights preserved. Current Cycle analytics still showing blank due to complex database query errors - deferred for future optimization.
- June 16, 2025. **NAVIGATION BUG FIXED** - Resolved non-functional "Sign Up for Free" button in navbar. Button was attempting to scroll to non-existent waitlist form element. Updated to properly navigate to `/auth?mode=signup` using wouter routing, matching behavior of other CTA buttons throughout the application.
- June 17, 2025. **CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM UNIFIED** - Fixed major authentication inconsistencies causing lesson completion failures and premium module access issues. Root cause was mixed token systems: JWT tokens for login (working) vs in-memory tokens for endpoints (failing after server restarts). Unified all authentication endpoints to use consistent JWT validation. Fixed parameter order mismatch in points awarding causing SQL errors. Authentication now works reliably across all platform features including lesson completion, user progress, premium access, and points system.
- June 17, 2025. **LESSON COMPLETION MESSAGING FIXED** - Resolved points display inconsistency where lesson completion screen showed conflicting point values (20 points at top vs "10+15=25" breakdown at bottom). Updated lesson completion component to use actual points earned from API response instead of hardcoded values. Now displays accurate total points awarded with optional streak bonus breakdown, eliminating user confusion about point calculations.
- June 17, 2025. **CYCLE POINTS TRACKING SYNCHRONIZED** - Fixed critical disconnect between lesson completion system and cycle points tracking. Root cause was markLessonComplete() only updating monthly points but not cycle points, causing "This Cycle" to show 0 despite earned points. Updated lesson completion to sync both monthly and cycle point systems simultaneously. Manually synchronized existing user points to cycle tracker. Dashboard now accurately displays current cycle progress.
- June 17, 2025. **ADMIN UI TERMINOLOGY MIGRATION COMPLETED** - Successfully completed Phase 1 frontend terminology updates to align admin interface with dynamic cycle backend capabilities. Updated all variable names (monthlyPoolSettings → cyclePoolSettings), API endpoints (/api/admin/monthly-pool-settings → /api/admin/cycle-settings), tab titles, dialog descriptions, and error messages. Removed hardcoded "$20 subscription" and "monthly cycle" references. Admin interface now properly reflects support for weekly/bi-weekly/custom duration cycles with configurable parameters.
- June 17, 2025. **USER UI PROFILE TERMINOLOGY MIGRATION COMPLETED** - Successfully completed Phase 1 user interface terminology updates for Profile page. Updated UserProfile interface (currentMonthPoints → currentCyclePoints), display text ("This Month" → "This Cycle"), tier progress calculations, and all point references to use cycle-based terminology. Profile page now consistently aligns with dynamic cycle backend system supporting configurable weekly/bi-weekly/custom duration cycles.
- June 17, 2025. **COMPLETE USER UI TERMINOLOGY MIGRATION FINISHED** - Successfully completed all 3 phases of user interface terminology updates. Phase 1 (Profile page), Phase 2 (Admin user-facing cards and UpgradePrompt component), and Phase 3 (Dashboard_backup.tsx) all updated from "monthly" to "cycle" terminology. Updated currentMonthPoints → currentCyclePoints throughout interfaces, changed "This Month" → "This Cycle" displays, and fixed component parameter passing. User interface now consistently matches dynamic cycle backend supporting weekly/bi-weekly/custom durations.
- June 18, 2025. **PAGINATION SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented complete pagination system for leaderboard component supporting 72+ users. Step 4.1: Backend pagination with getCycleLeaderboardPaginated() method accepting page/pageSize parameters. Step 4.2: Frontend pagination logic handling paginated API responses with working Previous/Next navigation. Step 4.3: Responsive mobile UI optimization with "Prev/Next" compact buttons and stacked layout for mobile, "Previous/Next" inline layout for desktop. Single component architecture maintained across all screen sizes. System displays 72 users across 4 pages of 20 users each with accurate rank calculations.
- June 18, 2025. **CRITICAL JWT AUTHENTICATION BUG FIXED** - Resolved authentication issue where new user registrations received malformed tokens causing "jwt malformed" errors when accessing lessons. Root cause was registration endpoint using storage.generateToken() (random hex strings) while login used proper jwt.sign(). Updated registration endpoint to use identical JWT generation as login with consistent secret key and 24h expiration. New users now receive valid JWT tokens immediately upon registration and can access lessons without authentication errors.
- June 18, 2025. **ENHANCED CYCLE STATISTICS DISPLAY COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented comprehensive cycle stats enhancement in "Strength in Numbers" section. Added tier-specific pool breakdown with dedicated colored boxes (Tier 1: $198, Tier 2: $118, Tier 3: $79) and prominent cycle countdown display showing days remaining with formatted end date ("December 31, 2025"). Backend APIs enhanced to provide dynamic tier calculations (50%/30%/20% split) and formatted cycle end dates. Frontend component restructured with proper visual hierarchy: tier boxes in separate 3-column row, cycle countdown in dedicated box alongside member count. Single component architecture maintained for mobile/desktop consistency.
