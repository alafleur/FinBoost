- Calculates user-specific tier advancement metrics
- Maintains existing pagination and data flow functionality
- Consistent with Dashboard Overview tab's professional fintech aesthetic

**Comprehensive Cache Invalidation + Data Sync Fix Completed** (January 2025) - Successfully resolved critical frontend cache invalidation issue where Excel import changes (750+ records updated in database) weren't displaying in admin UI. Root cause: browser caching + token expiration preventing fresh data fetch. Comprehensive solution implemented:

**Backend Enhancements:**
- Added `Cache-Control: no-store` headers to `/api/admin/winners/data/:cycleId` endpoint
- Enhanced authentication error logging with user tracking
- Comprehensive debug logging with timestamps for troubleshooting

**Frontend Cache Busting:**
- Updated `loadEnhancedWinners()` with `forceFresh` parameter + query timestamp (`?t=${Date.now()}`)
- Implemented 403 session expiry handling with user notifications
- Added Force Refresh button for manual cache invalidation

**Import Workflow Fix:**
- Excel import success handler now calls `loadEnhancedWinners(true)` with forced cache bust
- Corrected field mapping: `pointsAtSelection` properly displays Cycle Points data
- Removed pagination completely - single scrollable table eliminates cache inconsistencies

**Result**: Excel imports now display updated data immediately across all winner records with correct Cycle Points values. No more stale cache issues.

**Winner Celebration Notification System - Step 2 Backend API Enhancements Completed** (January 2025) - Implemented comprehensive backend infrastructure for winner celebration banners:

**Database Schema Enhancement:**
- Added `notificationDisplayed` boolean field to `cycleWinnerSelections` table with proper defaults
- All 750 existing winner records initialized with `notification_displayed = false`
- Migration completed successfully with non-destructive approach

**Storage Layer Implementation:**
- `getUserWinnerStatus()` method retrieves most recent sealed cycle winner status for users
- `markWinnerNotificationDisplayed()` method updates notification flag when users dismiss banners
- Enhanced `sealCycleWinnerSelection()` to reset notification flags on cycle sealing
- Comprehensive error handling and logging for winner status operations

**API Endpoints Added:**
- `GET /api/user/winner-status` - Returns user winner status for celebration banners
- `POST /api/user/winner-notification/dismiss` - Marks winner notification as displayed
- Proper authentication and validation on all endpoints
- Structured response format with error handling

**Integration Points:**
- Winner notifications reset to `false` when cycles are sealed (fresh celebration cycle)
- Only sealed cycles trigger winner notifications (prevents draft celebration)
- User-specific winner status tracking for personalized celebration experiences

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**Development Standards:**
- NO SHORTCUTS EVER - Always implement complete, production-ready solutions
- Never use placeholders or temporary fixes in production code
- Use realistic test data when needed for testing, but never fake data in production features
- Always trace issues to root cause rather than applying surface-level patches
- Verify every fix with actual testing and data validation
- Document exact changes made for transparency and accountability
- Use systematic debugging approach - identify, isolate, fix, verify
