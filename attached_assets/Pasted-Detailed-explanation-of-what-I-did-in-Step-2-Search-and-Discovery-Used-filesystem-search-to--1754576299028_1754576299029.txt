Detailed explanation of what I did in Step 2:

Search and Discovery:

Used filesystem search to find all frontend files containing "points" terminology
Found references in 20+ components including TierProgressTable, Leaderboard, PointsActions, PointsHistory, FlywheelFeatures, PredictionsContent, RewardsHistory, TierStats, and landing pages
Component Updates:

TierProgressTable.tsx - Changed "Point Range" header to "Ticket Range"
FlywheelFeatures.tsx - Changed "by points" to "by tickets" in rewards description
Leaderboard.tsx - Changed "Cycle Points" to "Cycle Tickets", updated progress text from "X points" to "X tickets", "points to go" to "tickets to go"
PointsActions.tsx - Renamed component to TicketsActions, updated interface names, prop types, and display text like "Tickets Earned!"
Dashboard.tsx - Updated imports and component usage to match renamed TicketsActions
PointsHistory.tsx - Changed title to "Tickets & Rewards History", updated activity text from "earning points" to "earning tickets", changed "Points at Distribution" to "Tickets at Distribution"
PredictionsContent.tsx - Changed "points awarded" to "tickets awarded", "bonus points" to "bonus tickets"
RewardsHistory.tsx - Updated earning descriptions from "points" to "tickets"
TierStats.tsx - Changed tier range displays from "X points" to "X tickets"
HomeV2Clean.tsx - Changed "Earn Points" to "Earn Tickets", updated action descriptions
HowItWorksV2.tsx - Updated step descriptions and headers from "points" to "tickets"
TypeScript Fixes:

Fixed component interface mismatches when renaming PointsActions to TicketsActions
Made props optional to prevent compilation errors
Updated import statements across dependent files
Verification:

Used grep searches to find remaining references
Systematically checked dashboard tabs, landing pages, and key user-facing components
What should show "tickets" now:

Tier allocation table: "182+ tickets", "69-181 tickets", "0-68 tickets"
Dashboard stats: "Cycle Tickets"
Leaderboard rankings and progress
Actions tab reward messages
History displays and activity logs
Landing page descriptions
