Step 2 Complete: Secure File Serving Implementation ✅
Summary of File Serving Security Implementation:

Core Security Features Implemented:
🔐 Authentication Mandatory - All file access requires valid JWT token
🛡️ Multi-layer Path Protection - Express routing + filename validation + path resolution verification
📁 Secure File Storage - Files isolated in uploads/ directory with restricted access
🔍 Security Auditing - Comprehensive logging of all file access attempts and security violations
🚫 Anti-Caching Headers - Prevents sensitive files from being cached by browsers/proxies
Security Validation Results:
✅ Authentication blocking works - All unauthenticated requests rejected with 401
✅ Path traversal protection works - Multiple security layers prevent directory access
✅ File type security works - Proper MIME type detection and Content-Type headers
✅ Error handling works - Safe error messages that don't leak system information
✅ Audit logging works - All access attempts logged with user identification

Technical Implementation:
Endpoint: GET /api/uploads/:filename
Authentication: JWT token validation via existing getUserFromToken()
File Validation: Filename sanitization, path traversal prevention, file existence verification
Security Headers: Content-Type, Cache-Control, X-Content-Type-Options, Content-Disposition
Error Handling: Comprehensive error responses for authentication, file access, and system errors
Integration Ready:
Frontend: FileUpload component can now reference uploaded files via returned fileUrl
Backend: Files accessible only to authenticated users through secure API endpoint
Admin Portal: Admin users can review proof files through protected file serving system
Security: Production-ready implementation with comprehensive audit trail and access controls
The upload system now has complete end-to-end security with both file upload protection (Step 1) and secure file serving (Step 2). The system is ready for frontend integration and user proof submission workflow.
