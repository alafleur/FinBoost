You're right on the root cause: `loadCycles()` is swallowing a 403 from an expired JWT, so `winnerCycles` stays empty and the whole “Winner Selection Cycles” block (and therefore the PayPal button) never mounts.

Here’s a tight fix that (a) detects 401/403, (b) clears the bad token, and (c) forces a re-auth redirect (consistent with your existing logout path `/auth`).

# 1) Patch `loadCycles()` to handle 401/403

Replace your current `loadCycles` with this:

```ts
// Winner cycle management functions
const loadCycles = async () => {
  try {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
    if (!token) {
      // No token — force login
      window.location.href = '/auth';
      return;
    }

    const response = await fetch('/api/admin/winner-cycles', {
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
    });

    // Handle expired/invalid auth
    if (response.status === 401 || response.status === 403) {
      // Optional: toast to explain what happened
      try {
        // if you have useToast in scope
        toast?.({
          title: "Session expired",
          description: "Please sign in again to view winner cycles.",
          variant: "destructive"
        });
      } catch { /* no-op if toast isn't available here */ }

      localStorage.removeItem('token');
      localStorage.removeItem('user');
      window.location.href = '/auth';
      return;
    }

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to load cycles: ${response.status}`);
    }

    const data = await response.json();
    if (data?.success) {
      setWinnerCycles(data.cycles);
    } else {
      setWinnerCycles([]);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to load cycles:', error);
    setWinnerCycles([]); // fail safe so UI can show empty state or error
  }
};
```

Why `/auth`? That’s already how your Logout button clears tokens and routes users back to sign-in, so we’re mirroring existing behavior for consistency.&#x20;
This replaces the current, silent version of `loadCycles` that doesn’t check `response.status`.&#x20;

# 2) Keep using your existing initialization call

You already call `loadCycles()` during the initial data load; with the patch above, an expired token will now trigger a re-auth instead of leaving `winnerCycles` empty.&#x20;

# Expected outcome

After re-auth (or with a fresh token), `loadCycles()` will populate `winnerCycles`, so the “Winner Selection Cycles” section renders and you’ll see your **“July 2/2 Test Cycle”** with the green **Selection Complete** badge and the blue **Process PayPal Disbursements** button as intended.

If you want this pattern everywhere, we can also factor a tiny `fetchWithAuth` helper that centralizes the 401/403 handling—but the targeted patch above is enough to unblock the PayPal button right now.
