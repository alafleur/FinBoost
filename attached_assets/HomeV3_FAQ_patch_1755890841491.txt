HomeV3 patch (manual steps)
1) Add this import near the top with your other imports:
   import FAQ from "@/components/FAQ";  // or "../components/FAQ" if you don't use path aliases

2) If HomeV3 already imports framer-motion, make sure it includes AnimatePresence:
   import { motion, AnimatePresence } from "framer-motion";

3) Render the FAQ just above your footer:
   ...
   <FAQ />
   <Footer />
   ...

4) No additional deps required. All Tailwind classes are static.
