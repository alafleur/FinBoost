I've reviewed the latest version of HomeV3.tsx on GitHub. Here's a clear and actionable set of instructions for Replit to implement the hybrid screenshot enhancement for the Tier System and Financial Education sections while maintaining visual clarity and flow:

ðŸ”§ Implementation Instructions for Replit

âœ… Goal

Integrate 1 screenshot each into the Tier System and Financial Education sections to enhance clarity and trustâ€”without cluttering the layout.


---

ðŸ“Œ 1. Tier System Section Update

Location: Section with heading: "FinBoostâ€™s Tier System Rewards Progress" (around line 770)

Instructions:

Add a right-aligned screenshot image (desktop-style) that shows the current Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3 boundaries or a point distribution graph from the admin panel or leaderboard.

Use a 2-column layout on desktop:

Left: current explanatory text and reward percentages

Right: image (with a Tailwind rounded-xl and shadow-lg)


On mobile, stack vertically with the image below the text.

Add caption below the image:

"See where you rank and how your points place you into reward tiers."

ðŸ“Œ 2. Financial Education Section Update

Location: Section with heading: "Financial Education That Pays Off" (around line 860)

Instructions:

Add a left-aligned mobile-format screenshot of a learning module in-progress (e.g. a lesson page with quiz results visible).

Use a 2-column layout on desktop:

Left: image (responsive, mobile-screenshot format, max-w-[250px])

Right: existing copy content


On mobile, stack with image above the text.

Add caption:

"Complete bite-sized lessons and quizzes like this to earn points and level up."



---

ðŸ’¡ Notes for Implementation

Ensure the images are placed within /public/assets or wherever your screenshot assets are stored.

Use responsive utility classes for Tailwind (flex flex-col lg:flex-row, gap-6, etc.).

Maintain consistent styling with previous "How It Works" section (rounded, bordered, soft drop shadows).

Avoid excessive whitespace between text and image.

Let me know once Replit implements the changes so I can review.
