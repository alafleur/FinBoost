📩 Message to Replit

Hi team — thanks for the latest changes. After reviewing the “Why FinBoost Isn’t Just Another Finance App” section, I noticed that the formatting doesn’t match the clean, modern look of the Platform Overview cards. Here’s what’s missing and what needs to change:


---

❌ Current Issues (compared to Platform Overview)

1. Card Layout

The icon is stacked on top of the text instead of left-aligned beside it.

Platform Overview uses a horizontal flex layout with the icon on the left and text on the right — much more polished and readable.



2. Icon Styling

Platform Overview icons use bg-slate-100, p-3, and rounded-full inside a flex container.

Current icons lack this styling, making them feel less cohesive and less visually appealing.



3. Typography

Titles in Platform Overview are styled with text-lg or text-xl, font-semibold, giving strong hierarchy.

Descriptions have good spacing and readability (text-sm or text-base, text-muted-foreground).

The current section’s text feels too uniform — needs stronger contrast between headings and body text.



4. Spacing & Sizing

Platform Overview cards have consistent padding (p-6, space-y-2) and margin between cards (gap-6, grid-cols-2).

The new section feels tighter and lacks balance on desktop — visually less engaging.

✅ What Needs to Be Done

Please copy the exact structure and styling used in the Platform Overview section (same card component and Tailwind classes), and apply it to the “Why FinBoost Isn’t Just Another Finance App” section.

Implementation Notes:

Use the same icon format: left-aligned icon inside a div with bg-slate-100 p-3 rounded-full

Place the icon and text in a horizontal flex container

Apply the same spacing, padding, and card background (rounded-xl, border, bg-white, etc.)

Keep the same typography hierarchy for heading and subtext

Use a 2-column layout on desktop, stacked on mobile (grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-1, etc.)

Optional: Sample JSX Template (based on Platform Overview)

<div className="flex items-start space-x-4">
  <div className="bg-slate-100 p-3 rounded-full">
    <PiggyBank className="w-6 h-6 text-slate-600" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">Worrying About Retirement, Not Just Next Month</h4>
    <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm">
      FinBoost isn’t just about surviving the month — it’s about building momentum toward long-term goals like retirement, homeownership, and freedom from paycheck-to-paycheck stress.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

This section is critical to building trust and resonance with prospective users, so it’s important the formatting reflects the same quality as the rest of the page.

Let me know if you need me to resend the exact copy for each card. Thanks!
