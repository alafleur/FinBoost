Detailed Issue Analysis: Winner Celebration Banner Not Displaying
The Problems:
1. Overly Restrictive Banner Logic
The current getUserWinnerStatus() method has multiple gatekeeping conditions that prevent banner display:

Winners: Only show if isSealed = true AND notificationDisplayed = false
Non-winners: Only show if they participated in most recent sealed cycle AND haven't dismissed
Result: Most users see no banner when they should see either winner celebration or community achievement
2. User 1980 (user180@test.com) - Known Winner Not Showing Banner
This is the smoking gun. If a confirmed winner sees no banner, the logic is fundamentally broken.

Root Cause Analysis:
Primary Suspect: notificationDisplayed Flag Logic
The most likely cause is that user 1980's winner record has notificationDisplayed = true, meaning:

They were flagged as "already shown the banner"
But they never actually saw it due to other bugs
Now they're permanently excluded from seeing celebration
Secondary Suspects:

Drizzle Query Error: The logs show Drizzle errors which might be silently failing the winner status queries

Sealed Cycle Issues: The winner query requires isSealed = true, but if Cycle 18 sealing has issues, no banners appear

Session Cache Problems: Non-winner dismissal uses session cache which might be corrupted or inconsistent

Current Faulty Logic Flow:
getUserWinnerStatus(userId) {
  1. Check if user is winner in sealed cycle with notificationDisplayed = false
     → If yes: return winner data
     → If no: continue to step 2
  
  2. Check if user participated in most recent sealed cycle
     → If no: return null (NO BANNER)
     → If yes: continue to step 3
     
  3. Check session cache for dismissal
     → If dismissed: return null (NO BANNER)
     → If not dismissed: return community stats
}
Required Fixes:
1. Simplify Banner Logic

Remove notificationDisplayed restriction for initial display
Show winner banners for ALL winners in most recent sealed cycle
Show community banners for ALL non-winners
Only respect dismissal after user manually dismisses
2. Fix Winner Detection

Query should find winners regardless of notificationDisplayed status
Only set notificationDisplayed = true AFTER user dismisses, not before
3. Remove Participation Restrictions

Non-winners shouldn't need participation checks to see community achievement
All users should see appropriate banner type until manually dismissed
4. Debug Data Issues

Check user 1980's actual database records
Verify Cycle 18 sealing status
Confirm winner records exist and are properly flagged
The fundamental issue is that the banner system was designed with too many restrictions, preventing the intended "show to everyone until dismissed" behavior.
