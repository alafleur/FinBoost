Nice progress — this version is close. I do see a couple blockers and one likely permission miss:

# Must-fix bugs

* **Bad array spread still present (crashes on create):**
  `setModules([.modules, data.module]);` → should be `setModules([...modules, data.module]);`. It appears twice in this file. &#x20;

# Likely auth miss

* **`/api/admin/pending-proofs` call has no token:**
  You’re fetching pending proofs without `Authorization`, while the rest of the admin endpoints use it. Add the header to be consistent with your other admin reads.&#x20;

  **Patch:**

  ```ts
  const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
  const response = await fetch('/api/admin/pending-proofs', {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
  });
  ```

# Good stuff (don’t change)

* **Reject proof now sends the token** (was missing before). Looks correct.&#x20;
* **Tabs-driven load** for both basic + enhanced winners fires on `'cycle-operations'` and sets persisted selection results. ✔️ &#x20;
* **Init harness** with named tasks + fallback `loadCycles()` is in and solid. &#x20;
* **Auth on other admin endpoints** (users, modules, cycle settings, winner details, etc.) looks consistent. &#x20;

# Quick diff you can paste

```diff
- setModules([.modules, data.module]);
+ setModules([...modules, data.module]);
```

(Apply in both `handleCreateModule` occurrences shown above.)

```diff
- const response = await fetch('/api/admin/pending-proofs');
+ const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
+ const response = await fetch('/api/admin/pending-proofs', {
+   headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
+ });
```

# One sanity check

* Make sure your **TabsTrigger** value actually is `"cycle-operations"` for the operations tab (your effect keys off that string). If the trigger still uses a different value like `"operations"`, the effect won’t run. The effect itself is correct; just confirm the tab value matches.&#x20;

Fix those two items and you should be in a good place. If you want me to skim **CycleOperationsTab** next, I can double-check the PayPal “ready” gating logic for the disbursement button.
