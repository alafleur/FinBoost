Here’s how you can integrate those three messaging improvements into your existing `HomeV3.tsx` structure without disrupting flow — and **strengthen the emotional arc and clarity** without relying on stats:

## 🧩 Suggested Insert Points and Rewrites

---

### ✅ **1. Relatability & Emotion**

**→ Insert at the top of the “Why FinBoost Exists” section** (just below the heading)

**Current heading**:

```jsx
<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-center">Why FinBoost Exists</h2>
```

**Suggested content** (new paragraph right after heading):

```jsx
<p className="text-lg text-gray-700 max-w-2xl mx-auto text-center mb-4">
  If you've ever paid off a debt and still felt behind, you're not alone. If you're trying to plan for retirement while juggling everyday bills — this is for you.
</p>
```

### ✅ **2. Collective Framing**

**→ Replace or rewrite your next paragraph in the same section** with stronger “we” framing.

**Current paragraph** (if present):

> “Financial stress is a shared problem... FinBoost flips the model…”

**Replace with**:

```jsx
<p className="text-lg text-gray-700 max-w-2xl mx-auto text-center mb-6">
  Most financial platforms keep us isolated. FinBoost turns that on its head: your learning, actions, and effort feed into a shared system of growth — where the community’s strength becomes your opportunity.
</p>
```

### ✅ **3. Clear Mechanics**

**→ Add this as a lead-in to your “How It Works” section**
(You likely have a section like `<h2>How It Works</h2>` — place this right above or just under the heading.)

**Insert this paragraph:**

```jsx
<p className="text-lg text-gray-700 max-w-2xl mx-auto text-center mb-6">
  Learn real money skills. Earn points for real financial actions. Compete for real rewards. And with company-funded prize boosts during Early Access — the timing has never been better.
</p>
```

This adds clarity to your hook **before** people get into the step-by-step mechanics.
