# HomeV3 Hero Sizing – Tailwind Literal Width Fix (Patch)

**Why this patch?**
Tailwind's compiler needs to *see literal class names* at build time.
Classes like `w-[${SCREEN_W_MOBILE}px]` or any template-literal will be **purged**,
which is why the desktop phone mockup keeps rendering at the wrong size.

**What this patch does**
- Replaces dynamic width classes with **literal pixel widths**:
  - `w-[240px]` (mobile)
  - `lg:w-[304px]` (desktop)
- Keeps your pixel-perfect `srcSet/sizes` so the screenshots stay crystal sharp.
- Adds a note on removing the small **“Learn to earn”** pill. If it’s rendered by a different component (e.g., `HeroLearnToEarn`), remove it there or add `hidden`.

**How to apply**
1. Save this zip locally and unzip.
2. From your project root, run:
   ```bash
   git apply homev3-hero-size-fix.patch
   ```
   If you don’t use git, open `client/src/pages/HomeV3.tsx` and apply the changes manually.

**Sanity checks after build**
- In DevTools, select the screenshot image element inside the phone:
  - CSS width should read **240px** (mobile) or **304px** (desktop).
  - `currentSrc` should be a matching 240w/304w (or 480w/608w on retina).
- Visually confirm the hero phone matches the earlier “good” iteration.
