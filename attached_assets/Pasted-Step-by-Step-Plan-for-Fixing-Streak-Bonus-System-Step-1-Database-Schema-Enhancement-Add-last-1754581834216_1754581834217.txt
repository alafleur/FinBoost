Step-by-Step Plan for Fixing Streak Bonus System:

Step 1: Database Schema Enhancement

Add lastStreakBonusDate column to users table (nullable string/date field)
Run database migration to add the new field
Step 2: Update Streak Logic in Storage Layer

Modify updateUserStreak() function to check if streak bonus already awarded today
Only calculate and award bonus if lastStreakBonusDate != today's date
Update lastStreakBonusDate when bonus is awarded
Maintain existing streak counting logic (consecutive days)
Step 3: Publish Streak Bonus Action

Navigate to Admin portal > Actions tab
Click "Publish" on the "Streak Bonus" action (currently in Draft)
This enables the system to actually award the calculated bonus points
Step 4: Test Implementation

Complete lesson on day 1 → verify base points + streak bonus awarded
Complete second lesson same day → verify base points only (no duplicate bonus)
Complete lesson next day → verify streak increments and bonus awarded
Skip a day, then complete lesson → verify streak resets to 1
Step 5: Verify Data Flow

Check user totals reflect both base lesson points and streak bonuses
Verify points history records show both lesson completion and streak bonus entries
Confirm frontend notifications match actual awarded points
Step 6: Update Documentation

Update replit.md with streak system clarification
Document the "once per day" bonus limitation
This ensures authentic data, maintains functionality, prevents exploitation, and delivers on user promises.

ok, go step by step. by thorough and careful. no shortcuts. no baseless assumption. single component desktop/mobile. dont move to next step withouth my permission. proceed with step 1

Step 1: Database Schema Enhancement

I'll add the lastStreakBonusDate field to the users table schema and run the migration.


Opened shared/schema.ts
I can see the users table schema. Now I need to add the lastStreakBonusDate field to track when the streak bonus was last awarded. I'll add it near the other streak-related fields.


Edited shared/schema.ts
Now I need to push this schema change to the database using the migration command:


Executed npm run db:push

Executed echo "no" | npm run db:push
Let me try a different approach to handle the interactive prompt:


Executed echo -e "\n" | npm run db:push
Let me try to run the migration directly by selecting the "No" option:


Executed printf "2\n" | npm run db:push
Let me check what's happening with the migration by looking at the database status and trying a different approach:

Let me try using the execute_sql_tool to manually add the column since the migration is having issues with the interactive prompt:


Executed SQL query ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN last_streak_bonus_date TEXT;
Executing SQL query
Perfect! The database column has been successfully added. Let me verify it was created correctly:


Executed SQL query SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'users' AND column_name = 'last_streak_bonus_date';
Step 1 Completed Successfully:

✅ Database Schema Enhanced

Added lastStreakBonusDate field to users table schema in shared/schema.ts
Field type: text (nullable, for ISO date strings YYYY-MM-DD format)
Database column created successfully via SQL: ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN last_streak_bonus_date TEXT;
Verified column exists and has correct data type and nullable constraint
The database now has the infrastructure to track when each user last received a streak bonus, enabling us to limit bonuses to once per day in the next step.

Ready for Step 2: Updating the streak logic in the storage layer to use this new field.
