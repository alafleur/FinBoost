Based on your analysis, I can see three distinct issues in the winner selection system:

Analysis of the Three Issues
Issue 1: Winner Count Discrepancy
The weighted random selection algorithm is not meeting the target winner counts despite having sufficient users. The problem appears to be in the selection logic where:

Tier 1: Target 225, got 172 (shortfall of 53)
Tier 2: Target 225, got 176 (shortfall of 49)
Tier 3: Target 300, got 217 (shortfall of 83)
This suggests the weighted random algorithm has a logic flaw where it's either:

Terminating early due to a condition being met prematurely
Having duplicate selections that are being filtered out
Not properly handling the random selection loop to reach the target count
Issue 2: Overall Rank Column Showing "#" Instead of Numbers
The database query error TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object at orderSelectedFields indicates a Drizzle ORM schema mismatch. The query is trying to process field selections but encountering undefined/null values, likely due to:

Incorrect join syntax between tables
Missing or misnamed database columns
Schema definition not matching the actual database structure
Issue 3: Export Function Failure
The export is failing because it depends on the same broken getCycleWinnerDetails query from Issue 2. Since the query returns empty results, there's no data to export, resulting in the 404 "No winner data found" error.

Root Causes
Winner Selection Algorithm: The weighted random selection logic has a mathematical or logical error preventing it from selecting the full quota of winners.

Database Schema Mismatch: The Drizzle ORM query structure doesn't match the actual database schema, causing the orderSelectedFields function to fail when processing joins or field selections.

Cascading Failure: The export depends on the database query, so fixing Issue 2 will resolve Issue 3.

The core problems are in the winner selection algorithm logic and the database query structure in the getCycleWinnerDetails method. The winner data is successfully being saved to the database (565 records), but the retrieval query is fundamentally broken.

do you see the issues in the code? just answer, no code changes

Yes, I can see several critical issues in the code based on the console logs and codebase analysis:

Primary Issues:
1. Authentication Token Issue
ReferenceError: require is not defined in storage.ts line 2150 in the getUserByToken method
The code is trying to use CommonJS require() in an ES module context
This is causing 403 "Admin access required" errors across multiple admin endpoints
2. Database Query Issues
TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object in Drizzle ORM's orderSelectedFields function
This is happening in the cycle winner details query, suggesting null/undefined values being passed to database operations
The error occurs when trying to get winner details after selection
3. Winner Selection Data Issues
The winner selection completes successfully (565 winners selected and saved)
But retrieving the winner details immediately fails with the database query error
This suggests a mismatch between what's being saved and what's being queried
4. Module Resolution Problems
The require error indicates the JWT verification in getUserByToken is using CommonJS syntax in an ES module
This breaks authentication for all admin operations
5. Frontend Connection Issues
Multiple Vite connection attempts and unhandled promise rejections
Google Analytics/GTM being initialized multiple times
Animation warnings for strokeDashoffset values
The core issue is the authentication system breaking due to module resolution problems, which cascades into admin access failures and prevents proper winner selection data retrieval.
