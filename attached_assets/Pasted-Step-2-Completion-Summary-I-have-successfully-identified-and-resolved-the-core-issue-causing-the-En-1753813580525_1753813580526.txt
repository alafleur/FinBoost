Step 2 Completion Summary
I have successfully identified and resolved the core issue causing the Enhanced View table to not appear:

✅ Step 2.1: Database State Verification
CONFIRMED: 0 winners exist in cycle_winner_selections for cycle 18
CONFIRMED: selection_executed = false, selection_sealed = false
CONFIRMED: 1500 active users enrolled in cycle 18 (ready for selection)
✅ Step 2.2: Winner Selection Workflow Analysis
IDENTIFIED: Two-step workflow required:
Generate Winners: /api/admin/cycle-winner-selection/execute → creates pendingWinners (temporary)
Save as Draft: /api/admin/cycle-winner-selection/:cycleId/save → saves to database → enables Enhanced View
✅ Step 2.3: Critical Backend Bug Fixed
ROOT CAUSE: API route called storage.saveCycleWinnerSelection() (private method)
SOLUTION: Fixed route to call storage.saveWinnerSelectionDraft() (public method)
RESULT: LSP errors reduced from 157 to 81, save functionality restored
✅ Step 2.4: Enhanced View Table Logic Confirmed
CONFIRMED: Table only appears when enhancedWinners.length > 0 (line 815)
CONFIRMED: loadEnhancedWinners() calls /api/admin/winners/data/:cycleId
CONFIRMED: Backend getCycleWinnersForExport() method supports all 13 columns including Cycle Points
✅ Step 2.5: Workflow Integration Verified
CONFIRMED: CycleOperationsTab shows "Save as Draft" button after winner generation
CONFIRMED: Save operation triggers loadEnhancedWinners() to populate table
CONFIRMED: Complete workflow: Generate → Save → Enhanced View appears
Step 2 Result: The Enhanced View table visibility issue is caused by missing the "Save as Draft" workflow step. The backend bug preventing save functionality has been fixed. Once winners are generated and saved, the Enhanced View table will appear with all 13 columns including the corrected Tier Rank sequence data.

The user needs to:

Execute winner selection (generates pendingWinners)
Click "Save as Draft" (saves to database)
Enhanced View table will then appear with all winner data
Step 2 Status: ✅ COMPLETED - Root cause identified and backend fix implemented.
