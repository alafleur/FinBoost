Thanks for the detailed update ‚Äî the implementation shows solid progress. Here's a breakdown of where things stand, why the UI is still freezing, and how to fix it:

---

## üß† Diagnosis: Why UI Is Still Freezing

Even with **pagination + memoization**, the **problem persists because**:

* You're **still fetching and storing all 749 records** in memory up front
* React **parses and stores that full array** in `winnerDetails` before pagination kicks in
* The blocking happens during the initial **load + setState + re-render**, especially with large payloads and `useMemo()` + deeply nested rows

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Fixes to Unblock UI

### üîπ 1. **Switch to Server-Side Pagination (Preferred)**

Instead of loading all 749 winners at once, load them in **batches of 50** based on current page.

#### Backend (`server/routes.ts` + `storage.ts`)

Update the winner fetch endpoint to accept:

```ts
?page=0&limit=50
```

Return only the needed subset:

```ts
SELECT * FROM cycle_winner_selections
WHERE cycle_id = $1
ORDER BY points DESC
LIMIT $2 OFFSET $3
```

#### Frontend (`Admin.tsx`)

Update:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetchWinnerPage(currentPage);
}, [currentPage]);
```

Store just 50 winners per page in state (`currentWinners`) instead of all `winnerDetails`.

**Benefit**: Avoids loading 749 rows at once, freeing the main thread and DOM render time.

### üîπ 2. **If You Must Keep Client-Side Fetching**

If server-side pagination isn‚Äôt feasible yet, consider:

* Deferring rendering until after `winnerDetails.length` is processed

* Use a lightweight `List` rendering library like [`react-window`](https://react-window.vercel.app/) even for paginated sections:

  ```tsx
  import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

  <List
    height={600}
    itemCount={paginatedWinners.length}
    itemSize={60}
    width="100%"
  >
    {RowRenderer}
  </List>
  ```

* OR break rendering into micro-chunks with `requestIdleCallback()` or `setTimeout(() => renderChunk(), 0)` if you stick with manual methods (but this is hackier)

---

### üîπ 3. **Fix TypeScript LSP Errors**

These are likely caused by:

* `useMemo()` having missing or loose return types
* Changes to deeply nested props in the table without updated interfaces

Suggested action:

* Use explicit types for memoized tables:

  ```tsx
  const memoizedTable = useMemo<JSX.Element>(() => {
    return <tbody>...</tbody>;
  }, [deps]);
  ```
* Add TypeScript interfaces for `WinnerRow`, `SelectionResult`, etc. as needed.
