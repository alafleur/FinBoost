Here's the final comprehensive step-by-step implementation plan:

Step 1: Database Schema Enhancement
Add notificationDisplayed boolean field to existing cycleWinnerSelections table
Leverage existing userCyclePoints table to identify all cycle participants
Use existing cycle analytics data for community stats (no new tables needed)
Step 2: Backend API Enhancements
Enhance existing /api/admin/cycle-winner-selection/${cycleId}/seal endpoint to:
Mark all participants with winner/non-winner status using batch database transaction
Set notificationDisplayed: false for all affected users in single operation
Calculate community stats using existing analytics functions
Return confirmation of notification setup completion
Create /api/cycles/current/user-status endpoint to return:
User's winner status for current cycle
Community achievement stats (total distributed, number of winners)
Whether notification has been displayed
Handle loading states and error conditions
Step 3: Frontend Components
Create CycleResultsBanner component using existing Card and Badge patterns
Build winner and non-winner variants within same component
Follow existing mobile-first patterns from Dashboard.tsx
Use established SectionHeader styling for consistency
Include loading and error states matching existing dashboard patterns
Step 4: Overview Tab Integration
Enhance existing Dashboard Overview tab to call /api/cycles/current/user-status
Use established useEffect and loadCycleAnalytics() patterns
Display loading state while fetching user status (consistent with existing UX)
Display CycleResultsBanner at top of Overview when active notifications exist
Mark notification as displayed after showing
Handle error states gracefully
Step 5: Admin Integration
Connect existing "Seal Winners" button to enhanced seal endpoint
Add visual confirmation that user notifications have been triggered
Show batch update progress and completion status
Maintain existing admin workflow without disruption
Step 6: Testing & Screenshots
Run cycle selection → seal → verify banners appear for both winner/non-winner users
Test banner persistence across user sessions until next cycle
Verify banners clear correctly when new cycle begins (reset notification state)
Validate batch database operations complete successfully
Capture mobile screenshots of both winner and non-winner experiences
Test loading states and error handling
This plan builds entirely on existing infrastructure while ensuring production-ready implementation with proper error handling, performance optimization, and UX consistency.
