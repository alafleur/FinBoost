Revised Step-by-Step Plan (Following Best Practices)
Step 1: Verify Backend API Implementation
Start the application and verify /api/admin/winners/data/${cycleId} route exists in server/routes.ts
Check if the route is properly connected to the getCycleWinnersForExport() method in server/storage.ts
Test the endpoint directly with cycle ID 18 to confirm it returns proper enhanced data structure
Verify the database query correctly joins cycle_winner_selections with user data
Step 2: Validate Database State and Winner Persistence
Confirm the 750 generated winners are actually saved to cycle_winner_selections table
Check if the winner selection workflow requires explicit "Save as Draft" step that wasn't completed
Verify the saveCycleWinnerSelection() method is being called and committing properly
Ensure the tierRank values are using my selection sequence implementation (1, 2, 3...) not performance ranking
Step 3: Debug Frontend State Management Flow
Examine loadEnhancedWinners() function in CycleOperationsTab.tsx for proper error handling
Add comprehensive logging to identify why enhancedWinners state isn't populating
Verify the API response structure matches what setEnhancedWinners() expects
Check if handleSaveWinnerSelection() is properly calling loadEnhancedWinners() after success
Step 4: Fix Race Conditions and Timing Issues
Implement proper database transaction completion verification before API calls
Add retry mechanism or loading states for Enhanced View data loading
Ensure proper sequential execution: Generate → Save → Load Enhanced Data → Render Table
Step 5: Complete End-to-End Testing and Verification
Execute complete workflow with comprehensive logging at each step
Verify Enhanced View table appears with all 13 columns including Cycle Points
Confirm Tier Rank shows selection sequence order (1, 2, 3, etc.) with my implementation
Test Excel export/import functionality with the enhanced data structure
Key Focus: Start with backend verification first, as the root cause is most likely that the enhanced data API endpoint isn't properly connected to the saved winner data, not a frontend rendering issue.
