Love it. While Postmark approval finishes, here’s a tight, high-impact next-steps plan you can ship now (no dependency on approval).

# 0) Wire it into signup (must-do)

* **Trigger verification on signup:** call `POST /api/auth/verify/request { email }` after creating the user.
* **Gate access:** treat `emailVerified=false` as limited mode (e.g., dashboard banner + block sensitive actions).
* **Add “Resend verification”** button on the “check your inbox” screen.

# 1) UX polish (1–2 hours)

* **Verification banner:** If `!emailVerified`, show a dismissible banner on Dashboard with a “Resend” CTA.
* **Reset page copy:** Add strength meter + show password rules.
* **Success redirects:** After verify/reset, redirect to login with a toast.

# 2) Security hardening (quick wins)

* **Rate limiting:** `express-rate-limit` on `/verify/request` and `/password/request` (e.g., 5/min/IP).
* **CAPTCHA (optional):** add hCaptcha/Cloudflare Turnstile to `/password/request`.
* **Token storage defense:** store only a **hash of the token** in DB (prevents use if DB leaked). Keep the raw token only in the link.

# 3) Ops & observability

* **Webhook ingestion:** Persist Postmark webhook events (Delivery, Bounce, SpamComplaint) to a table.
* **Suppression logic:** Auto-suppress **marketing** to bounced/complaint addresses; allow critical transactional at your discretion.
* **Runbook:** Add alerts on repeated bounces per domain (>5/day) and API send failures.

# 4) Backfill plan (your 1,503 users)

* **Mark existing users as unverified** (if not already).
* **Soft campaign:** Queue verification emails in small batches (e.g., 200/hour) once approval lands.
* **UI notice:** If a user logs in unverified, surface banner + CTA.

# 5) Payout notifications hookup

* In your PayPal disbursement success path, call:

  ```
  getEmail().send('payout-processed', {
    to: user.email,
    model: { cycleId, amountPretty, supportEmail, brandAddress }
  });
  ```
* Add an admin “Resend payout email” action on the batch details panel.

# 6) Content/branding quick pass

* **Finalize copy** in templates (subject lines + legal footer).
* **Plain-text part:** already auto-generated, but glance over for readability.
* **Support links:** ensure `support@getfinboost.com` is consistent.

# 7) Compliance touch (Canada/CASL)

* Transactional is fine without unsubscribe, but keep **business identification** in footer (address + support email). You’ve done this—just confirm address is final.

If you’d like, I can:

* ship a tiny **VerificationBanner.tsx** and **Resend route** patch, or
* add a **token hashing** update to the router + migration, or
* create a **webhook ingestion** table + handler you can drop in.

Tell me which one you want first, and I’ll deliver the ready-to-drop files.
