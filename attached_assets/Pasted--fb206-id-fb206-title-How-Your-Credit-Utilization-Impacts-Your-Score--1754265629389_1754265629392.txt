But it also affects how lenders perceive your risk level. A 30% utilization is often cited as a target, but the optimal range is typically much lower if you’re preparing to apply for credit.</p><h3>Why It Matters</h3><ul><li>FICO models heavily weight revolving credit usage — high utilization signals elevated risk.</li><li>Lenders also view it behaviorally: maxed-out cards may suggest cash flow issues, even if you pay in full.</li><li>Credit utilization is calculated per card and in aggregate — both matter.</li><li>If you’re near a major credit event (e.g., mortgage), aim for <10% for optimal impact.</li></ul>",
