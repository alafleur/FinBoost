Absolutely—thanks for the careful hand-off. I made **surgical, minimal** updates that slot into your current structure (no page rewrite this time). Your existing `HomeV3.tsx` already renders the hero via `<HeroLearnToEarn />` and the Early Access section via `<EarlyAccessGuarantee />`, so we only need to drop in refined versions of those two components.&#x20;

# What’s included (single-component, responsive, brand-consistent)

* **HeroLearnToEarn.tsx**

  * Keeps a **single `<h1>`** (“LEARN REAL FINANCE TOOLS / EARN REAL CASH”) with the blue→indigo gradient you’re using elsewhere.
  * **Tickets language** baked into the subhead (“collect tickets for cash drawings—free to join.”).
  * **Dual CTAs** (Start Free / How it works).
  * **No scale animations**—opacity/translate only so the phone screenshot stays crisp.
  * **Pixel-perfect screenshot delivery** using your 240/480/304/608 **width-based `srcSet`** + exact `sizes` for zero blur on mobile & desktop (incl. retina).
  * Inline **ticket + tools badges** (decorative, `aria-hidden`), matching your brand blue/indigo—no off-brand colors.

* **EarlyAccessGuarantee.tsx**

  * Keeps your **Early Access Guarantee** presentation (headline + 4 tiles) with your gradient/rounded card look.
  * Simple motion (opacity/translate), no scale.

I did **not** touch any other sections. If you previously added console debug in “How it works,” you can remove it later for cleanliness; it’s optional and separate from this change.

# Download (drop-in only)

[Download the update (zip)](sandbox:/mnt/data/finboost_hero_update.zip)

**Files inside:**

```
client/src/components/HeroLearnToEarn.tsx
client/src/components/EarlyAccessGuarantee.tsx
docs/README_hero_update.md
```

# How to apply (2 minutes)

1. **Copy** both component files into your repo at the same paths:

```
client/src/components/HeroLearnToEarn.tsx
client/src/components/EarlyAccessGuarantee.tsx
```

> `HomeV3.tsx` already imports/uses them, so no further code changes should be required.&#x20;

2. *(Optional but recommended)* Preload the LCP hero image in `index.html`:

```html
<link rel="preload" as="image" href="/assets/screenshots/step1_m240.png"
  imagesrcset="/assets/screenshots/step1_m240.png 240w, /assets/screenshots/step1_m480.png 480w, /assets/screenshots/step1_s304.png 304w, /assets/screenshots/step1_s608.png 608w"
  imagesizes="(min-width:1024px) 304px, 240px"
  fetchpriority="high">
```

3. *(Optional)* If you still have the “PIXEL-PERFECT TEST” logs in the “How it works” phone image `onLoad`, remove them to keep prod logs clean later.

# Why this is safe

* **Single component** pattern preserved (hero works on both desktop/mobile).
* **Brand & spacing** follow the same Tailwind tokens (blue/indigo gradients, rounded-xl/2xl, container widths, paddings).
* **Image crispness** preserved—same width-based `srcSet` / `sizes` approach you validated.

If anything feels off after you paste these in, ping me and I’ll tweak the copy/spacing **without** touching the rest of the page.
