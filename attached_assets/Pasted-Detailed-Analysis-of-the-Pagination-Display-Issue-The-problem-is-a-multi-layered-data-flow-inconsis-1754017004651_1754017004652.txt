Detailed Analysis of the Pagination Display Issue
The problem is a multi-layered data flow inconsistency between the Excel import/export system and the frontend pagination display. Here's the complete breakdown:

Root Cause: Frontend is Using Multiple Data Sources
The admin portal has two different pagination systems that handle the same data differently:

CycleOperationsTab.tsx - Uses loadEnhancedWinnersPaginated() function
Admin.tsx - Uses loadEnhancedWinnersPaginated() function (different implementation)
The Data Flow Problem
Excel Export/Import Flow:

Export orders by overall_rank (1, 2, 3... 750)
Import updates records by matching email addresses
Database correctly stores updated payout_override and payout_final values
Frontend Display Flow:

Backend pagination was ordering by tier + tierRank instead of overall_rank
This meant page 1 showed different records than rows 1-50 in Excel
Page 15 (last page) showed different records than rows 701-750 in Excel
Specific Technical Issues
Backend Ordering Mismatch:

Fixed: Changed from .orderBy(tier, tierRank) to .orderBy(overallRank)
This should align pagination with Excel ordering
Missing Enhanced Columns:

Fixed: Added payoutOverride, payoutFinal to SELECT statement
Frontend was getting hardcoded values instead of database values
Frontend Data Mapping:

Fixed: Updated frontend to use winner.payoutFinal instead of winner.finalAmount
Why Changes Still Don't Show on Later Pages
Despite the fixes, the issue persists because there are likely additional data flow layers:

React Query Caching: Frontend may be serving cached data for later pages
Multiple API Endpoints: Different parts of the admin portal may call different backend functions
Component State Management: Frontend pagination state may not be refreshing properly after imports
The Import Logs Confirm Success
The logs show:

[updateWinnerPayoutData] Updated winner 1856 with percentage: 0, override: 400, final: 400
[updateWinnerPayoutData] Updated winner 2982 with percentage: 0, override: 300, final: 300
[updateWinnerPayoutData] Updated winner 2042 with percentage: 0, override: 300, final: 300
[updateWinnerPayoutData] Successfully updated 750 winner records
This proves the import is working correctly - it's updating the last few records with the new values (400, 300, 300). The database has the correct data, but the frontend pagination isn't displaying it properly.

Conclusion
The core issue is that the frontend pagination display system is not properly synchronized with the Excel import/export ordering system. While the backend fixes should resolve this, there may be additional caching or state management issues preventing the updated data from showing on later pages of the admin portal.
