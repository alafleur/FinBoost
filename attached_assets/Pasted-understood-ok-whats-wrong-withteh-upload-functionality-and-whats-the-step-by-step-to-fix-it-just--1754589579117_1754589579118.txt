I need to investigate the upload functionality issue first. Let me search for the current upload implementation to understand what's broken.


Searched for "Find the upload functionality components and backend routes to understand how proof submissions currently work"

Searched for ""

Searched for "Find proof submission API routes and endpoints in the backend"
Now let me search for the specific upload route that the FileUpload component calls:


Searched for "Find the /api/upload/proof route handler in the backend server routes"
Upload Functionality Issue Analysis:

Based on my investigation, here's what's wrong and the step-by-step fix:

The Problem:
The FileUpload component calls /api/upload/proof but this route doesn't exist. The backend only has:

/api/points/submit-proof - for submitting proof metadata after upload
File upload routes are missing entirely
Current Broken Flow:
✅ User selects file in FileUpload component
❌ Component calls /api/upload/proof - ROUTE DOESN'T EXIST
❌ Upload fails, no file stored
❌ Proof submission can't continue
Step-by-Step Fix Plan:
Step 1: Add Missing Upload Route
Create /api/upload/proof endpoint using multer middleware
Handle file upload and return file URL/metadata
Integrate with existing fileUpload.ts configuration
Step 2: Fix Upload-to-Submission Connection
FileUpload component gets file URL from upload
Pass file URL to proof submission flow
Connect to existing /api/points/submit-proof endpoint
Step 3: Update Frontend Integration
Ensure TicketsActions component properly handles FileUpload callbacks
Connect uploaded file URLs to proof submission forms
Add proper error handling for upload failures
Step 4: Add File Serving Route
Create route to serve uploaded files at /api/uploads/:filename
Enable viewing of uploaded proof files in admin panel
Root Cause: The upload functionality was designed but the critical upload endpoint was never implemented, causing the entire proof submission system to fail at the file upload stage.

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this fix systematically?

ok, once the endpoint is in place, the upload will go to the 'Proof Review' tab of the Admin portal for teh Admin to revew, assign tickets rewarded (points), and approve? in the interim, the user should see that their submissinog is under review and the status should update to Approved (with ticket rewarded) / Not Approved once the Admin submits... do you agree with this flow? if so, pls send the revised plan to make sure everything is captured. just answer, no changes yet

Yes, I completely agree with that flow! Here's the revised comprehensive plan:

Upload Functionality Complete Flow & Fix Plan
User Experience Flow:
User submits proof → FileUpload component uploads file → Gets "Submission Under Review" status
Admin reviews → Proof Review tab shows pending submissions with file attachments
Admin decides → Approves/rejects with custom ticket amounts and reasoning
User sees result → Status updates to "Approved (X tickets awarded)" or "Not Approved (reason)"
Technical Implementation Plan:
Step 1: Create Missing Upload Endpoint

Add POST /api/upload/proof route using multer middleware
Return {fileUrl, fileName, fileSize} on successful upload
Handle authentication and file validation
Step 2: Add File Serving Route

Add GET /api/uploads/:filename to serve uploaded files
Enable admin to view proof attachments during review
Step 3: Connect Upload to Proof Submission

FileUpload component calls upload endpoint first
Gets file URL, then calls existing /api/points/submit-proof with file URL
Maintains existing proof review workflow in admin portal
Step 4: Enhance User Status Display

Show "Under Review" status for pending proofs
Display final outcome (approved tickets or rejection reason)
Update when admin completes review
Step 5: Admin Portal Integration

Proof Review tab displays file attachments as clickable links
Admin can view files before approving/rejecting
Maintains existing approval/rejection functionality
Key Benefits:
✅ Preserves existing admin review workflow
✅ Users get clear status feedback throughout process
✅ No disruption to current proof management system
✅ Files are properly stored and accessible for review

This plan maintains all existing functionality while fixing the missing upload infrastructure. Ready to proceed with implementation?
