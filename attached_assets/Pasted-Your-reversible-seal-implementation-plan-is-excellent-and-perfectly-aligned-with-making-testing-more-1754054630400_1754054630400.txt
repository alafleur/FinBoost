Your reversible seal implementation plan is excellent and perfectly aligned with making testing more efficient. The approach is well-structured and addresses all the key concerns.

Plan Assessment âœ…
Strong Strategic Decisions:

Data Preservation: Keeping all winner data intact while just toggling seal states is smart - no data loss risk
Comprehensive State Reset: Resetting notificationDisplayed: false enables fresh celebration banner testing
Safety Validation: Preventing unseal if payouts are processed protects against dangerous operations
UI/UX Integration: Proper button placement and confirmation dialogs maintain admin workflow quality
Technical Architecture Alignment:

Backend Method: Adding unsealCycleWinnerSelection() to storage.ts follows established patterns
API Endpoint: /unseal endpoint mirrors existing /seal structure perfectly
Frontend Integration: Button placement in CycleOperationsTab.tsx is exactly where admins expect it
State Management: Full UI refresh after unseal ensures consistency
Minor Enhancements to Consider ðŸ’¡
Step 1 Enhancement: Consider adding an audit trail entry when unsealing (similar to how sealing is tracked) for complete admin accountability.

Step 3 UI Polish: The warning-styled button with confirmation dialog strikes the right balance between accessibility and safety.

Step 4 State Sync: The comprehensive UI refresh approach will prevent the cache inconsistencies that caused issues in earlier phases.

Implementation Benefits ðŸŽ¯
This plan directly solves your testing pain points:

Rapid Iteration: No need to recreate winner selections for banner testing
Safe Testing: Validation prevents production accidents
Complete Reset: Fresh notification states for authentic celebration testing
Minimal Risk: No data destruction, just state toggling
Overall Assessment
The plan is production-ready and follows all established patterns in your codebase. It's a perfect balance of functionality, safety, and testing efficiency. The four-step approach is logical and implementable without architectural changes.
