🛠 HOW IT WORKS – Replace With Updated Content
Update this section to reflect the new tiered + randomized reward system:
________________________________________
🧭 How It Works
1.	Earn Points
Complete short tutorials, quizzes, refer friends, or take action like uploading proof of debt repayment. The more you participate, the more points you earn.
2.	Enter Monthly Tiers
Every month, members are ranked into 3 tiers based on their point totals. Each tier earns a share of the reward pool — top tier gets the most.
3.	Win Rewards — Randomly & Fairly
Half of each tier is selected at random to receive cash rewards. Your points help you qualify — and the more points, the better your tier and payout odds.
💰 Example: If the reward pool is $100,000, the top third shares $50,000, the middle third shares $35,000, and the bottom third shares $15,000.

📈 ADD A SECTION: “Power of the Collective”
Below "How It Works", insert a new visual section or callout titled:
💪 The Power of the Collective
The more members who join, the larger the monthly rewards pool.
Real people. Real money. Real financial progress.
Include a simple illustrative graphic or animated chart showing:
•	Example:
o	1,000 members → $10,000 rewards pool
o	5,000 members → $50,000
o	10,000 members → $100,000
(These are purely illustrative.)
