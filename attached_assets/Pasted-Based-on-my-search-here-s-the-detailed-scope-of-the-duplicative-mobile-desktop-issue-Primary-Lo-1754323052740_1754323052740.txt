Based on my search, here's the detailed scope of the duplicative mobile/desktop issue:

Primary Location: client/src/pages/HomeV3.tsx
1. "What You'll Master" Section (Lines 283-375)

Mobile: Single card carousel with navigation arrows and dots (md:hidden)
Desktop: Horizontal scrolling layout with all cards visible (hidden md:block)
Duplication: Completely separate components with different interaction patterns
2. App Preview Section (Lines 1098-1400+)

Mobile Navigation (Lines 1098-1141): Arrows and dots positioned above phone (lg:hidden)
Mobile Cards (Lines 1187-1260): Single flipping card with tap interaction (lg:hidden)
Desktop Cards (Lines 1262+): Static grid of 4 cards with hover states (hidden lg:block)
Duplication: Two entirely different card systems and navigation approaches
3. MasterTopicsSection Component (Embedded in HomeV3.tsx)

Mobile: Single card with navigation arrows and dots
Desktop: Horizontal scroll with all topics visible
Same pattern: Complete UI separation with md:hidden and hidden md:block
Secondary Location: client/src/components/Leaderboard.tsx
Lines 365, 378: Mobile/desktop display differences using md:hidden
Scope: Likely table vs card layouts for leaderboard data
Scope Assessment:
High Impact Areas (Major Duplication):

HomeV3.tsx App Preview: ~300+ lines of duplicate mobile/desktop code
HomeV3.tsx Master Topics: ~100+ lines of separate mobile/desktop implementations
MasterTopicsSection: Complete component duplication
Medium Impact Areas:

Leaderboard component: Table/card layout differences
Navigation patterns: Various mobile/desktop nav implementations
Code Bloat: Approximately 500-600 lines of duplicative code that could be consolidated into responsive single components.

Maintenance Overhead:

Any design changes require updating 2+ separate implementations
Bug fixes need to be applied to multiple code paths
Inconsistent user experience across breakpoints
Harder to maintain design system consistency
Root Cause: Heavy use of lg:hidden/hidden lg:block pattern instead of responsive design with CSS Grid/Flexbox and Tailwind breakpoint classes.
