âœ… Fix Plan: Dashboard Profile UX Refactor
ðŸ§© 1. Remove Redundant Profile Tabs
File: client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx

Action:

Mobile View: Delete TabsTrigger with value="profile" in the TabsList around lines 450â€“470

Desktop View: Delete TabsTrigger with value="profile" in the TabsList around lines 480â€“500

Grid Class: Change grid-cols-7 back to grid-cols-6 to match original layout

ðŸ”„ 2. Update "Setup Payment Info" Button Flow
File: client/src/components/RewardsSummary.tsx

Current Code:

tsx
Copy
Edit
const handleSetupPayment = () => {
  navigate('/dashboard?tab=profile');
};
Updated Code (Suggested):
Replace with a direct call to trigger the existing header Profile modal or sidebar drawer, assuming the profile access is handled via a context or component method:

tsx
Copy
Edit
import { useProfileModal } from '@/hooks/useProfileModal'; // adjust if different

const { openProfileModal } = useProfileModal();

const handleSetupPayment = () => {
  openProfileModal('paypal'); // pass context if needed (e.g., focus PayPal config section)
};
ðŸ”§ If modal is not yet modularized, consider abstracting openProfileModal into a global context or header-linked component for access across components like RewardsSummary.

ðŸ§  3. Ensure Header Profile Button Triggers PayPal Configuration
File: client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx

Lines ~200â€“220: Header section with Profile avatar dropdown/modal

Action:

Ensure the header Profile button opens a modal or drawer that includes:

PayPal info setup section

User info / account management area

Enhancement (optional):

Allow openProfileModal('paypal') to auto-scroll/focus the PayPal config input within the modal

ðŸ”„ 4. Preserve 6-Tab Architecture
Action: Confirm that final structure maintains this tab order:

Overview

Learn

Referrals

Predictions

Rewards

Leaderboard

This maintains architectural clarity and avoids tab bloat by treating Profile access as distinct from gamified flow tabs.

ðŸ“Œ Summary of Benefits
âœ… Removes UX confusion from duplicate navigation

âœ… Fixes broken Setup Payment Info path

âœ… Restores original design architecture (6 tabs)

âœ… Aligns with dashboard UX norms (Profile via header)
