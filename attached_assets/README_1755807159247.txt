Hero RHS patch (frameless screenshot + subject tags + ticket bubble)

Place this file at:
  client/src/components/HeroLearnToEarn.tsx

This only adjusts the RIGHT side of the hero to match the earlier design:
- no phone frame (frameless screenshot)
- angled blue accent
- subject tags stacked on the left of the screenshot
- ticket bubble bottom-right
- mobile order preserved by the surrounding layout (text first, screenshot second)

It keeps the crisp image pipeline via width-based srcSet (240/480 and 304/608).
