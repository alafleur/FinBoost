Thanks — and based on the screenshot, **you’re absolutely right to flag this**. Even though Replit says the `/dashboard?tab=profile` navigation is wired up, **it’s clearly not activating the Profile tab**. Instead, you're still seeing the **Overview** tab on load — not Profile.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

Here’s the likely issue:

### ❌ Problem:

The Dashboard tab state is likely **defaulting to "overview"**, ignoring the `tab` URL parameter unless explicitly handled.

### 🧠 Even though the URL says:

```
/dashboard?tab=profile
```

…the internal state probably still does:

```ts
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('overview'); // ← hardcoded fallback
```

Unless your code *explicitly* pulls from `useSearchParams()` or `window.location.search` on mount and sets `activeTab`, the tab won’t switch.

## ✅ How to Fix It (for Replit or you)

### In `Dashboard.tsx`:

1. **Import**:

```ts
import { useSearchParams } from 'react-router-dom';
```

2. **Initialize from URL param**:
   Replace:

```ts
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('overview');
```

With:

```ts
const [searchParams] = useSearchParams();
const defaultTab = searchParams.get('tab') || 'overview';
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState(defaultTab);
```

> ✅ This ensures that on initial load, if `tab=profile`, the profile tab is selected.

---

## ✅ Optional: Sync URL When Changing Tabs

To make the experience consistent and navigable by back button:

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  navigate(`/dashboard?tab=${activeTab}`, { replace: true });
}, [activeTab]);
```

> You may already have this in place — just confirming it works both directions.

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

Once this fix is in:

1. Go to `/dashboard?tab=profile`
2. You should **immediately land on the Profile tab** (not Overview)
3. Clicking "Setup Payment Info" should now visually activate the tab

| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `/dashboard?tab=profile` loads Overview tab | `useState('overview')` hardcoded | Parse URL `tab` param as initial state |
| Replit says it's working, but it's not      | They didn't test actual behavior | Add `useSearchParams()` + fallback     |
