Issues with the Current Plan:

Your diagnosis is partially correct but misses critical implementation details and contains some inaccuracies:

API Endpoint Confusion: You're focusing on loadPaginatedWinnerDetails() which calls /api/admin/cycle-winner-details/${cycleId}/paginated, but the Enhanced View table actually depends on loadEnhancedWinners() which calls /api/admin/winners/data/${cycleId}. These are different endpoints serving different purposes.

State Variable Mix-up: The Enhanced View table renders based on enhancedWinners.length > 0, not paginatedWinners.winners.length > 0. You're tracking the wrong state variable.

Incomplete Workflow Analysis: Your plan doesn't address the complete workflow: "Generate Winners" → "Save as Draft" → "Enhanced View". The missing link is ensuring loadEnhancedWinners() is called after the save operation AND that the backend API properly populates the enhanced data.

Backend API Gap: You haven't verified if /api/admin/winners/data/${cycleId} is properly implemented and connected to the saved winner data in the database.

My Suggested Step-by-Step Plan:

Step 1: Verify Backend API Implementation

Check if /api/admin/winners/data/${cycleId} route exists and is properly implemented
Verify it queries the correct database tables (cycle_winner_selections and related user data)
Test the endpoint directly to confirm it returns data after winner selection is saved
Step 2: Fix State Management Flow

Ensure handleSaveWinnerSelection() calls loadEnhancedWinners() after successful save (which it already does)
Add proper error handling and logging to loadEnhancedWinners() to identify why it's not getting data
Verify the response structure matches what setEnhancedWinners() expects
Step 3: Address Race Condition

Add a small delay or retry mechanism in loadEnhancedWinners() after winner selection save
Ensure database transaction is fully committed before the API call
Consider adding a loading state specifically for the Enhanced View
Step 4: Fix Conditional Rendering Logic

The rendering condition enhancedWinners.length > 0 is correct, but add better debugging
Add fallback UI states for when data is loading or empty
Ensure proper error messaging when the Enhanced View fails to load
Step 5: End-to-End Testing

Test the complete workflow: Generate → Save → Enhanced View appears
Verify the Tier Rank column shows proper selection sequence (1, 2, 3, etc.)
Test Excel export/import functionality works with the enhanced data
Key Difference: The core issue is likely that the backend API endpoint /api/admin/winners/data/${cycleId} isn't properly implemented or isn't returning the enhanced winner data structure that the frontend expects. Your plan focused too much on the frontend state management without addressing the backend data source.

Recommendation: Start with Step 1 (backend verification) before touching any frontend code, as this is most likely where the root cause lies.
