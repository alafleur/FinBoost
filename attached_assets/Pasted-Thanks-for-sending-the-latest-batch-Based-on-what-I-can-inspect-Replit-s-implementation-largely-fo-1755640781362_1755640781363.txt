Thanks for sending the latest batch. Based on what I can inspect, Replit’s implementation largely follows what we designed (validation, suppression, stream routing, webhook), but there are a few production-readiness gaps I’d still close before we stamp this “done”.

## Quick verdict

* ✅ Core pieces are in: 7-layer validation, suppression checks, transactional vs broadcast, webhook → suppression.
* ⚠️ Missing (or unclear) from what I can see:

  1. **Webhook authenticity**: I don’t see HMAC signature verification. Without it, anyone could spoof a “bounce” and suppress an address.
  2. **Centralized guard at the service layer**: Your provider checks are good, but we also want validation + suppression enforced in `EmailService.send(...)` so *any* provider (now or later) can’t bypass it.
  3. **Broadcast compliance niceties**: Add `List-Unsubscribe` on broadcast sends to keep reputation strong and help recipients exit gracefully.
  4. **Safer dev testing**: A small rate-limit on the `/api/dev/email-test` route prevents accidental spikes.

I’ve packaged those final improvements as a tiny addendum so you can drop them in.

### What’s inside

* `server/services/email/EmailService.ts`
  Centralized pre-send guard (validation + suppression) so *all* providers are safe.
* `server/services/email/providers/postmark.ts`
  Domain guard, correct stream headers, and **`List-Unsubscribe`** for broadcast sends.
* `server/routes/postmarkWebhook.ts`
  **HMAC signature verification** (Express raw body) via `POSTMARK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
* `server/routes/devEmailTest.ts`
  Secret-protected **and rate-limited** test route.
* `server/services/email/types.ts` and `.env.postmark.addendum.example`
  (Type defs + env hints)
* `README.md` with wiring instructions.

## How to wire (1 minute)

1. Copy the files from the zip into your repo (keep paths).
2. Add to your server bootstrap:

```ts
import { registerPostmarkWebhook } from "./server/routes/postmarkWebhook";
import { registerDevEmailTest } from "./server/routes/devEmailTest";

registerPostmarkWebhook(app);
registerDevEmailTest(app); // dev only
```

3. Set env vars (example file included):

```
POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN=pm_...
POSTMARK_MESSAGE_STREAM_TRANSACTIONAL=outbound
POSTMARK_MESSAGE_STREAM_BROADCAST=broadcast
POSTMARK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=change_me
EMAIL_FROM="FinBoost <notifications@getfinboost.com>"
EMAIL_REPLY_TO="support@getfinboost.com"
EMAIL_UNSUBSCRIBE_LINK="https://getfinboost.com/unsubscribe"
DEV_EMAIL_TEST_SECRET=change_me
```

---

## Final production checklist

* **DNS**: DKIM + SPF for `getfinboost.com` (and DMARC=`p=none` to start).
* **From address**: always the verified domain (no @gmail).
* **Streams**: transactional flows → `outbound`; bulk/AMOE → `broadcast`.
* **Webhook**: confirm it returns **200 OK** quickly and records events; with HMAC on.
* **Bounce rate recovery**: send the remaining quota only to known-good inboxes to dilute the early 7/7 bounces (7/70 = 10%).
* **Templates**: broadcast templates include clear footer + unsubscribe info (the header helps but add the footer text too).
* **Logs/metrics**: watch Postmark dashboard + your own logs for `error:*` and `suppressed`.

If you want, I can also bundle a tiny suppression viewer endpoint/UI next so you can see (and unsuppress) addresses without touching the DB.
