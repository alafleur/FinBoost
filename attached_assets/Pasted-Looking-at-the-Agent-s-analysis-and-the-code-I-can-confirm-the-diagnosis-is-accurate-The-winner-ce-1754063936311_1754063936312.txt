Looking at the Agent's analysis and the code, I can confirm the diagnosis is accurate. The winner celebration banner system has several architectural issues preventing proper display.

Root Cause Analysis
1. Overly Restrictive Logic in getUserWinnerStatus()
The current implementation has too many gatekeeping conditions:

Winners must have notificationDisplayed = false
Non-winners must pass participation checks
Complex session cache dismissal logic
2. Database Query Issues
From the console logs, there's a Drizzle ORM error:

Error getting user winner status: TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object
This suggests the query is failing silently, causing the method to return null/empty results.

3. Premature notificationDisplayed Flag Setting
The flag appears to be set to true before users actually see the banner, permanently excluding them from celebrations.

Key Issues to Address
Backend (server/storage.ts - getUserWinnerStatus method):

Query Error: The Drizzle query is throwing errors due to malformed field selection
Logic Flow: Too many early returns prevent banner display
Sealed Cycle Logic: Overly restrictive sealed cycle requirements
Frontend (WinnerCelebrationBanner.tsx):

Display Logic: shouldShowCelebration() may have additional restrictions
State Management: The hook might not be handling loading/error states properly
Database State:

User 1980: Likely has notificationDisplayed = true when it should be false
Cycle 18: May have sealing issues affecting winner queries
Recommended Fix Strategy
Phase 1: Simplify Banner Logic

Remove notificationDisplayed restrictions for initial display
Show banners for ALL winners in most recent sealed cycle
Show community stats for ALL non-winners
Only respect dismissal AFTER manual user action
Phase 2: Fix Database Query

Resolve the Drizzle ORM error in the winner status query
Ensure proper field selection and join conditions
Phase 3: Reset Banner State

Reset notificationDisplayed = false for affected users (like user 1980)
Implement proper dismissal workflow that doesn't permanently exclude users
The Agent's analysis correctly identifies that this is a systemic issue with the banner display logic being too restrictive, combined with database query failures. The solution requires both simplifying the logic and fixing the underlying technical errors.
