Short answer: phases 1–2 look fine so far, but there’s a **front-end gating bug** that will keep your “Enhanced Winners” loader from firing even after the backfill.

Here’s what I’m seeing in **Admin (3).tsx**:

* Your “load paginated winners when the operations tab opens” effect checks **`activeTab === 'operations'`**.
* But your Tabs are **uncontrolled** (they use `defaultValue="overview"` and never update `activeTab`), so `activeTab` never changes from `"overview"`.
* Net effect: that useEffect never runs, so `loadPaginatedWinnerDetails(...)` won’t auto-fire on tab switch—even if the UI looks right.

What to change (2 tiny fixes):

1. **Control the Tabs with state**

```tsx
<Tabs value={activeTab} onValueChange={setActiveTab} className="space-y-6">
```

(Replace the current `defaultValue="overview"` Tabs usage that isn’t wired to state.)

2. **Match the tab value string**
   If your tab trigger uses `"cycle-operations"` (common in this codebase), update the effect’s guard to that:

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  if (activeTab === 'cycle-operations') {
    const activeCycle = cycleSettings.find(c => c.isActive);
    if (activeCycle?.id) {
      loadPaginatedWinnerDetails(activeCycle.id, 1, winnersPerPage);
      if ((activeCycle as any).selectionCompleted) {
        setSelectionResults({
          winnersSelected: (activeCycle as any).totalWinners || 0,
          totalRewardPool: ((activeCycle as any).totalRewardPool || 0) / 100,
          selectionMode: 'loaded_from_database'
        });
      }
    }
  }
}, [activeTab, cycleSettings]);
```

Right now it’s checking `'operations'`, which likely doesn’t match the trigger value.

Good news on your init harness:

* The named `Promise.allSettled` batch + belt-and-suspenders `loadCycles()` retry is in place and looks solid.
* `loadCycles()` itself is logging and handling 401/403 properly.

So: backend investigation/backfill ✅, but wire up the tab state and fix the tab value check so your winners list and PayPal-related UI react when you switch to the operations tab.

If you paste the server query/route for the paginated winners endpoint next, I’ll sanity-check the JOIN for `paypalEmail` too.
