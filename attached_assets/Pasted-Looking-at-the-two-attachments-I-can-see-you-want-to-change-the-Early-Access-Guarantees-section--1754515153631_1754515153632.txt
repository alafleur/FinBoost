Looking at the two attachments, I can see you want to change the "Early Access Guarantees" section (first attachment) to match the format of the "Why FinBoost Isn't Just Another Finance App" section (second attachment).

Step-by-Step Implementation Plan for Agent:
1. Identify Current Location
Find the "Early Access Guarantees" section in client/src/pages/HomeV3.tsx
This appears to be in the early access/hero area of the landing page
2. Format Changes Required
From: Current card-based layout with icons and borders
To: Bold blue rectangular cards with white text (matching the "Why FinBoost" section)

3. Visual Structure Updates
Remove: Individual card containers with borders and shadows
Remove: Circular icon backgrounds
Replace with: Solid blue gradient rectangular cards
Update: Text color to white for contrast
Maintain: 2x2 grid layout for desktop, stacked for mobile
4. Content Mapping
Transform each guarantee into a blue card format:

"$5,000+ Minimum Pool Size" → Blue card with bold white title
"40%+ Minimum Member Win Rate" → Blue card with bold white title
"50% Membership Fees Back To Rewards" → Blue card with bold white title
"$250+ Minimum Top Reward" → Blue card with bold white title
5. CSS Classes to Apply
Use same classes as "Why FinBoost" cards: bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-blue-700
White text: text-white
Bold titles: font-bold text-lg
Proper padding and rounded corners: p-6 rounded-xl
6. Responsive Considerations
Mobile: Single column stack with full width cards
Desktop: 2x2 grid layout maintaining visual balance
Maintain: Same responsive breakpoints as existing "Why FinBoost" section
7. Best Practices to Maintain
Keep single component structure (no separate mobile/desktop components)
Use existing Tailwind utility classes
Maintain accessibility with proper heading hierarchy
Preserve semantic HTML structure
Keep consistent spacing with rest of page
8. Implementation Steps
Locate the guarantees section in HomeV3.tsx
Replace the current card structure with blue gradient cards
Update text colors to white
Remove icon containers and borders
Apply responsive grid classes
Test mobile and desktop layouts
Ensure text contrast meets accessibility standards
The key is transforming from the bordered card-with-icon format to the solid blue rectangular card format while maintaining the same responsive grid behavior and content hierarchy.
