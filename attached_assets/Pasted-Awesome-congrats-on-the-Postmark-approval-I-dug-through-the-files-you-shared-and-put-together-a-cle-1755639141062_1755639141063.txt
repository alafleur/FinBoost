Awesome—congrats on the Postmark approval. I dug through the files you shared and put together a clean, *drop-in hardening patch* that (1) stops sends to addresses that will bounce, (2) separates Transactional vs Broadcast streams, (3) records & suppresses bounces/complaints, and (4) gives you a safe dev test route.

### What was wrong (quickly)

* The Postmark provider always tried to send, regardless of past bounces/suppressions, and always used the default stream.&#x20;
* You already receive webhook events and write them to the DB, but you weren’t *checking suppression before sending*, so bad addresses kept being retried. &#x20;
* The database already has proper tables for events & suppressions, so we can enforce “don’t send” centrally.&#x20;
* You have a solid email validator—let’s use it at send-time too.&#x20;

## ✅ Download the patch

**[Download: postmark-hardening-patch.zip](sandbox:/mnt/data/postmark-hardening-patch.zip)**
(Contains only safe, generic code—no secrets.)

### What’s inside (new/updated files)

```
server/services/email/types.ts
server/services/email/render.ts
server/services/email/suppressions.ts
server/services/email/providers/postmark.ts

server/routes/postmarkWebhook.ts
server/routes/devEmailTest.ts

```

### Highlights

* **Pre-send suppression check**: skip sending to any email in `email_suppressions`.&#x20;
* **7-layer validation** before send (uses your existing validator).&#x20;
* **Transactional vs Broadcast** stream routing with sane defaults (verify/reset/payout → Transactional, AMOE/bulk → Broadcast).
* **Webhook** stays idempotent and turns hard bounces/complaints/inactive into suppressions automatically.&#x20;
* **Dev test route** (`/api/dev/email-test`) protected with a secret header—so you can test without risking your bounce rate.
* **ENV** plumbing via `.env.example` (no real keys included).

## How to install (straightforward)

1. **Copy files** from the zip into your repo (preserve folders).
2. **Set env vars** using `.env.example` (token, from address, streams).
3. **Wire routes** in your server bootstrap (where you register routes):

```ts
import { registerPostmarkWebhook } from './routes/postmarkWebhook.js';
import { registerDevEmailTest } from './routes/devEmailTest.js';

registerPostmarkWebhook(app);
registerDevEmailTest(app); // dev only
```

4. **Set Postmark webhook** → `POST https://<your-domain>/api/webhooks/postmark`.

---

## How this keeps you under 10% bounce

1. **We never send to suppressed addresses** (suppressed by webhook or manual).
2. **We validate & normalize** before any send (reject obvious bad/placeholder emails).&#x20;
3. **Streams are correct**: Transactional (outbound) for one-to-one, Broadcast for bulk.
4. **Dev testing won’t harm reputation** (secret-guarded route + you choose the stream/recipient).

## Postmark dashboard steps (quick)

* **Verify sender domain & DKIM** (Postmark ➜ Sender Signatures).
* **Use the Transactional stream** for all app flows; reserve Broadcast for opt-in lists.
* **Warm up**: start with a couple of your own inboxes (e.g., @gmail), not placeholder domains.
* **Turn on the webhook** now so every bounce/complaint is captured and suppressed.

### Why this matches your codebase

* It uses your existing tables `email_events` and `email_suppressions`.&#x20;
* It keeps the provider pattern and Postmark JSON API you’re already using.&#x20;
* It reuses your validator and extends your current suppression utilities.&#x20;

If you want me to bundle this as a PR-style diff instead of a zip, say the word and I’ll drop that in next.
