I disagree with the Agent's analysis. Looking at the code and logs, the Lesson component is being called and the navigation is working correctly.

Evidence the Agent is Wrong
The Dashboard Overview tab DOES navigate to lesson routes: Looking at Dashboard.tsx, the Overview tab modules clearly use setLocation(\/lesson/${module.id}`)`:
onClick={() => {
  console.log(`Overview tab - Module clicked: ID=${module.id}, Title=${module.title}`);
  console.log(`Overview tab - Module validation:`, validateModule(module));
  console.log(`Overview tab - Route being used: /lesson/${module.id}`);
  
  if (!validateModule(module)) {
    console.error('Overview tab - Invalid module data, preventing navigation:', module);
    return;
  }
  
  setLocation(`/lesson/${module.id}`);
}}
The Lesson component IS running: Looking at Lesson.tsx, I can see extensive logging including:

"ðŸ”„ LESSON: Starting lesson fetch..."
"ðŸ”„ LESSON: Lesson ID from params:"
"ðŸ”„ LESSON: Fetching user data..."
"ðŸ”„ LESSON: Fetching modules..."
The server logs show lesson access: The console output shows successful API calls for modules and user authentication that the Lesson component would be making.

The Real Issue
The Agent's fix to use useParams() instead of manual URL parsing was correct, but there might still be issues with:

Module ID validation - The Dashboard is validating modules before navigation
Route pattern mismatch - The Dashboard uses /lesson/${id} but the App.tsx routing might expect a different pattern
Authentication redirects - The Lesson component redirects to /auth or /education if certain conditions aren't met
Testing the Current State
To verify if the fix is working, you should:

Check the browser's network tab when clicking Overview modules
Look for the "ðŸ”„ LESSON:" console logs
Verify the URL actually changes to /lesson/{id}
Check if any redirects are happening in the Lesson component
The Agent's analysis about "missing LESSON logs" is incorrect - the Lesson component IS being called, and the navigation IS happening. The issue is likely in the Lesson component's logic flow or authentication checks, not in the Overview tab navigation.
