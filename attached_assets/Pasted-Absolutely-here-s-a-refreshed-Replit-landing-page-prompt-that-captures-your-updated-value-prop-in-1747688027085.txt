Replit Prompt: Pre-Launch Waitlist Landing Page

Page Goal:
Build a sleek, trustworthy, and modern pre-launch waitlist landing page for a learn-to-earn membership platform designed to help people in financial hardship improve their financial literacy and win monthly cash rewards. The platform relies on collective participation — the more people join, the bigger the monthly rewards pool. This page should capture emails and get users excited to sign up.

Design Guidelines:

Clean, modern UI with soft tones and strong typography (trustworthy, mission-driven aesthetic)

Use friendly illustrations or infographics rather than photos

Responsive and mobile-friendly

Strong, central call to action: "Join the Waitlist"

Sectioned layout for clear value prop communication
