You're asking the exact right question ‚Äî this is a positioning tradeoff between focus and inclusivity. Here's the breakdown:

üß† Core Dilemma

Option A: Focus only on debt paydown

‚úÖ Clear, trackable, mission-aligned (solving the debt crisis)

‚úÖ Strong hook for users in financial distress

‚ùå May alienate users not in debt (e.g. crypto bros, fantasy players, budgeters)


Option B: Keep broader ‚Äúfinancial actions‚Äù language

‚úÖ Inclusive of more ICPs (savers, side hustlers, gamers)

‚úÖ Lets you expand tracking later (e.g. savings, retirement, investing)

‚ùå Vague in the short term, could feel like over-promising




---

‚úÖ Recommendation: Use a tiered framing that leads with debt paydown, but allows for broader participation.

üì£ Marketing Copy Example:

> ‚ÄúGet rewarded for taking real financial action ‚Äî especially paying down debt.‚Äù
We‚Äôre building a system that celebrates actual financial progress. Right now, we‚Äôre focused on tracking debt paydown ‚Äî the #1 financial stressor in North America ‚Äî but soon we‚Äôll support more ways to earn, like saving and investing.



This does 3 things:

1. ‚úÖ Sets expectations honestly ‚Äî right now it‚Äôs debt-focused


2. ‚úÖ Signals broader vision ‚Äî users not in debt don‚Äôt feel excluded


3. ‚úÖ Keeps copy flexible ‚Äî no need to backtrack later
