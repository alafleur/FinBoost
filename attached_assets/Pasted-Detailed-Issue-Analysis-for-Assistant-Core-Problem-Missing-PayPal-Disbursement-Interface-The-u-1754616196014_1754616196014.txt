Detailed Issue Analysis for Assistant:

Core Problem: Missing PayPal Disbursement Interface
The user is correctly navigating to Admin Portal → Cycle Management tab but the PayPal disbursement functionality is completely missing from the interface.

What Should Be Displayed vs. What's Actually Showing:
Expected Interface Structure:
"Cycle Configuration" section ✅ (Currently visible)
"Winner Selection Cycles" section ❌ (Missing entirely)
Should display July 2/2 cycle as clickable card
Shows selection/disbursement status badges
"Selected Cycle Actions" section ❌ (Missing - appears after cycle click)
Contains the blue "Process PayPal Disbursements" button
Also has "Run Random Selection", "View Winners", "Export CSV" buttons
Current Reality:
Only "Cycle Configuration" section is rendering
No "Winner Selection Cycles" section visible
User sees cycle parameter editing interface with "Complete Cycle" button instead
Root Cause Analysis:
The missing interface is controlled by the winnerCycles state variable in Admin.tsx (lines 5242-5296). This section only renders when winnerCycles.length > 0.

Likely Issues:

API Endpoint Problem: /api/admin/winner-cycles is not returning data or failing
Data Structure Mismatch: The API returns data but in wrong format for the UI
State Loading Issue: winnerCycles state is not being populated from API response
Authentication/Permission: Winner cycles API requires different auth than cycle settings
Evidence from Logs:
GET /api/admin/cycle-settings 304 - ✅ Working (shows "July 2/2" in cycle config)
No corresponding /api/admin/winner-cycles requests visible in logs
750 winners exist for cycle 18 (July 2/2) based on backend logs
Technical Root Cause:
The disbursement functionality exists in two separate data structures:

cycleSettings - Powers cycle configuration interface (working)
winnerCycles - Powers winner selection/disbursement interface (broken/missing)
The PayPal button is in the winnerCycles interface, not the cycleSettings interface the user is currently viewing.

Required Fix:
Assistant needs to investigate why winnerCycles data is not loading and ensure the "Winner Selection Cycles" section renders properly with the July 2/2 cycle available for selection and disbursement processing.
