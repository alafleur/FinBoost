Complete 4-Step Overview Tab Bug Investigation Process
Here's what I systematically accomplished to fix the Overview tab lesson click issues:

Step 1: Verify lesson data and navigation links
Goal: Check if Overview tab modules have correct data and URLs
Actions: Examined Dashboard component's module rendering and link generation
Findings: Overview tab correctly displays modules with proper /lesson/${module.id} links
Result: Data structure was correct, issue was elsewhere
Step 2: Check lesson loading and error handling
Goal: Verify Lesson component properly receives and processes module data
Actions: Added detailed logging to track lesson fetch process, user authentication, and module lookup
Findings: Lesson component had comprehensive error handling and logging already in place
Result: Component structure was sound, pointed to routing issue
Step 3: Check for route pattern mismatch between Overview and Learning tabs
Goal: Identify if there were routing conflicts causing 404 errors
Actions: Examined App.tsx routes and searched for conflicting education routes
Findings: Found redirect logic in Lesson component that sends users to /education when lesson ID parsing fails
Result: Identified the root cause - faulty URL parsing triggering incorrect redirects
Step 4: Fix the root cause - Lesson component URL parsing issue
Goal: Replace unreliable manual URL parsing with proper wouter parameter handling
Actions:
Imported useParams hook from wouter
Replaced manual path splitting with params.id
Simplified redirect logic to prevent false triggers
Added enhanced logging for debugging
Findings: Manual parsing pathParts[pathParts.length - 1] was unreliable
Result: Fixed the core routing issue causing Overview tab clicks to fail
The Problem Flow:
User clicks module in Overview tab → navigates to /lesson/64
Lesson component tries to parse URL manually → parsing fails or gets wrong value
Component triggers redirect to /education → creates /education/64 URL (as seen in screenshot)
/education/64 route doesn't exist → 404 error
The Solution:
Replaced fragile manual URL parsing with wouter's reliable useParams() system that directly accesses route parameters defined in the /lesson/:id route pattern.
