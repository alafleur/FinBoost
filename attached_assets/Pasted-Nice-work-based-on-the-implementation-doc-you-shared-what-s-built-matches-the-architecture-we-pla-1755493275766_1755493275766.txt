Nice work — based on the implementation doc you shared, what’s built matches the architecture we planned (webhook → event log → auto-suppressions + admin endpoints). I don’t see red flags in the approach. Here’s a tight QA list of things to double-check so we’re rock-solid in prod:

# Looks correct / aligned

* Ingests Delivery, Bounce, SpamComplaint, Open, Click; logs full payloads; secures with `POSTMARK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`; suppresses **marketing** on **hard bounces** & **complaints**; admin endpoints for events/suppressions.&#x20;

# Quick verification checklist (please confirm)

1. **Only one webhook mounted**
   Ensure there isn’t both the “old” and “enhanced” route mounted at `/api/webhooks/postmark` (duplicate mounts would double-record events).

2. **Admin auth actually enforced**
   The doc says admin endpoints require auth—confirm `router.use(requireAdmin)` (or equivalent) wraps:

   * `GET /api/admin/email/events`
   * `GET /api/admin/email/suppressions`
     Also add a small rate limit on these to be safe.

3. **Idempotency on events**
   Postmark can retry webhooks. Add a lightweight guard to avoid duplicate event rows:

   * DB unique index suggestion: `(message_id, type, received_at)` or a deterministic `sha256(payload)` column with `UNIQUE`.
   * If you keep raw inserts, at least tolerate duplicates in analytics.

4. **Secret handling**
   Query param secrets are OK, but consider supporting **header-based signing** (Postmark’s `X-Postmark-Signature`) in addition to `?secret=` so secrets don’t show up in logs/URL analytics. (Optional hardening.)

5. **Bounce taxonomy**
   You’re suppressing on **hard** bounces (correct). Optionally:

   * track repeated soft bounces per address and suppress after N in 30 days.
   * log bounce subtype (e.g., `BAD_DOMAIN`, `MAILBOX_FULL`) for diagnostics.

6. **PII hygiene**
   You’re storing the full JSONB payload (great for audits). Add a redaction step for anything sensitive you don’t need long-term (e.g., message bodies if they ever appear, though Postmark webhook payloads typically exclude bodies).

7. **Indexes actually created**
   The doc mentions “optimized indexes”—ensure they exist:

   * `email_events (email)`, `email_events (type, received_at DESC)`
   * `email_suppressions (email UNIQUE)`

8. **Marketing guard in practice**
   Confirm **only** the marketing pipeline checks `isSuppressed(email)`; **transactional** sends must bypass this (as intended in the doc).&#x20;

9. **Webhook performance**
   Handler should return 200 quickly. If you later add heavy logic, push to a job queue (but right now you’re fine).

# Smoke tests you can run now

* **Unauthorized webhook:** POST without `?secret=` ⇒ `401`.
* **Delivery event:** POST a sample event ⇒ `{"ok":true,"count":1}` and row appears in `email_events`.
* **Hard bounce:** POST bounce ⇒ row in `email_events` **and** email appears in `email_suppressions` with reason `bounce`.
* **Admin endpoints:** Hitting them unauthenticated should 401/403; authenticated should paginate & filter correctly.

If you want, I can supply a tiny patch for (a) header-signature verification, and (b) an idempotency unique constraint + safe upsert — just say the word and I’ll drop in the ready-to-paste TS/SQL.
