## 🛠 INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLIT

### 🔁 General Update Overview

We are upgrading the current "How It Works" and "Platform Overview" sections to be more **visual and trust-building** by integrating real **screenshots** for key user flows.

---

### ✅ 1. HOW IT WORKS SECTION — REBUILD

**File:** `client/src/pages/Home.tsx`
**Section ID:** `id="how-it-works"`

**Changes:**

* Rename section heading to:
  `How It Works — See FinBoost in Action`

* Replace the existing 3-step card layout with a **vertical or stacked layout** of 3 collapsible (or tabbed) cards — one per step:

#### Step 1: Learn Financial Skills

* Keep your original copy.
* Insert screenshot: `lesson-module.png` (screenshot of lesson interface)
* Caption: *“Complete short lessons like this to earn 20 points.”*

#### Step 2: Submit Real Financial Actions

* Keep your updated debt paydown–focused copy.
* Insert screenshot: `debt-submission.png`
* Caption: *“Verified debt payments earn big bonus points.”*

#### Step 3: Compete for Cash Rewards

* Keep your point-weighted language.

* Insert screenshot: `leaderboard.png`

* Caption: *“Your point total determines your odds — the top contributors win real cash.”*

* **Optional:** Make screenshots clickable to view larger (modal or zoom).
