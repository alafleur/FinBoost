Prompt for Replit (Update Existing Landing Page):

Update the current waitlist landing page with the following refinements to improve clarity, trust, and appeal for financially burdened users:

Core Messaging Updates
Replace the term “subscription” with “membership” throughout the page.

Emphasize the collective power of the community:
"The more members who join, the larger the rewards for everyone."

Update the core value prop to reflect a virtuous cycle:
"Learn smart money habits → Earn points → Qualify for monthly cash rewards → Improve your finances → Repeat."

Hero Section
Update subheadline:
“Join a powerful collective transforming financial stress into financial progress — and get rewarded for every step forward.”

Add a short line under the CTA:
“More than half of all membership fees go back to members as monthly cash rewards.”

Include an illustrative graphic that shows how the monthly rewards pool grows as more people join (e.g., $10k at 1k members, $50k at 5k members, etc.).

How It Works Section (Updated)
Become a Member – $19.99/month (with the majority of fees going back to the community)

Earn Points – Learn, take quizzes, refer others, and show proof of good financial habits (like repaying debt)

Qualify for Monthly Rewards – The top 50% of members based on points receive cash rewards, distributed by tier

Fuel the Collective – Every action you take helps the entire rewards pool grow larger

Terminology Fixes
Replace words like “win” or “odds” with:
“earn rewards,” “qualify for payouts,” or “become eligible.”
Clarify: This is a merit-based system, not chance-based.

FAQ Enhancements
Add or update answers to cover:

How rewards are distributed (merit-based to top 50% by points)

Monthly membership cost: $19.99

Time commitment: 5–20 minutes/week

Types of actions that earn points (learning, referrals, uploading proof of debt repayment or savings)

Data privacy: “Your financial data is secure, never sold, and your rewards are transparently calculated.”

Call to Action Update
Add text below the final CTA:
“Get in early to help grow the rewards pool and your financial future.”
