Phase 1 & 2 Implementation Details for Assistant Reference
Phase 1: Tab Structure Setup
Tab Layout Updates:

Modified both mobile and desktop TabsList from grid-cols-6 to grid-cols-7 to accommodate the new tab
Added "Actions" TabsTrigger between "Learn" and "Board" tabs in both layouts
Used Upload icon (<Upload className="h-4 w-4" />) for visual consistency
Applied identical styling classes to match existing tab design with blue→purple gradient active states
Tab Content Integration:

Added <TabsContent value="actions"> sections in both mobile and desktop layouts
Positioned content between Learn tab (ending line 776) and Referrals tab (starting line 778) for mobile
Positioned content between Learn tab (ending line 1394) and Leaderboard tab (starting line 1396) for desktop
Integrated with existing SectionHeader component using Upload icon and "Financial Actions" title
Wrapped PointsActions component in consistent white card with gray border styling
Import Addition:

Added import PointsActions from "@/components/PointsActions"; to Dashboard.tsx imports
Phase 2: Component Integration and Styling Updates
TypeScript Error Resolution:

Changed selectedAction state from string | null to number | null to match action.id type
Updated submitProof function to use selectedAction.toString() for API compatibility
Removed unused handleFileUpload function that was causing interface conflicts
Fixed FileUpload component integration by using proper onFileUploaded callback
UI Element Removal (per user requirements):

Points Display: Removed {action.basePoints} pts badges, replaced with category display
Max Restrictions: Completely removed the conditional block showing "Max 1/month", "Max daily", "Max total" limits (lines 229-239)
Investment Contribution Filtering: Added filter in fetchActions() to exclude actions containing "investment contribution" or "investment" in name/actionId
Design System Integration:

Updated getCategoryColor() function to use platform's blue→purple color scheme:
action: blue-50/blue-700/blue-200
achievement: purple-50/purple-700/purple-200
default: gray-50/gray-700/gray-200
Applied gradient styling to selected action cards: bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-purple-50
Enhanced card hover effects with hover:shadow-lg hover:scale-[1.02] and border color transitions
Updated submit button with platform gradient: bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-purple-600
Applied gradient background to submission form card: bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 via-white to-purple-50
Added blue accent to Upload icon in form header: text-blue-600
Component Architecture Maintained:

Preserved single-component responsive design pattern
Maintained existing props interface for backward compatibility
Kept responsive grid layout (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3)
Preserved all existing functionality while removing specified UI elements
The implementation follows the established "NO SHORTCUTS EVER" principle with complete TypeScript compliance, proper error handling, and professional styling that matches the platform's marketing-ready appearance standards.
