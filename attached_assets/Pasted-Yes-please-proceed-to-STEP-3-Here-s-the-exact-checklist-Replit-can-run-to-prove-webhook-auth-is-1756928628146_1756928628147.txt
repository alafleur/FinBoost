Yes—**please proceed to STEP 3.** Here’s the exact checklist Replit can run to prove webhook auth is enforced.

# STEP 3 — Webhook auth enforcement verification

## What to verify

That your webhook route **rejects bad Basic Auth** and **accepts the correct one**.

## Do this

1. **Negative test (should fail)**

   * Postmark → *Default Transactional Stream* → **Webhooks → Edit** your webhook.
   * In **Basic auth credentials**, temporarily change the **Password** (e.g., append `-bad`).
   * Click **Send test** (Delivery).
   * **Expected:** Postmark shows **401/403** (not 200).
     *Server logs should show the request was rejected for bad auth.*

2. **Positive test (should pass)**

   * Revert the password in Postmark to the **correct** value.
   * Click **Send test** again.
   * **Expected:** **200 OK** and your handler runs normally.

3. **Optional curl pen-test**

   * With **wrong** creds:

     ```bash
     curl -i -X POST https://getfinboost.com/api/webhooks/postmark \
       -H "Authorization: Basic $(printf 'postmark:WRONG' | base64)" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
     ```

     Expect **401/403**.
   * With **correct** creds (replace `PASSWORD`):

     ```bash
     curl -i -X POST https://getfinboost.com/api/webhooks/postmark \
       -H "Authorization: Basic $(printf 'postmark:PASSWORD' | base64)" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
     ```

     Expect **200**.

## Acceptance criteria

* Bad credentials → **401/403** from your server and **Webhook failed** in Postmark test.
* Correct credentials → **200** and **Webhook delivered** in Postmark test.
* Env vars are set and used: `POSTMARK_WEBHOOK_BASIC_USER`, `POSTMARK_WEBHOOK_BASIC_PASS`.
* Auth check runs **before** any event processing.

> If the negative test returns **200**, add/enable a Basic Auth middleware in the webhook route (constant-time compare). After that, repeat the tests.

### After STEP 3 passes

Move to **STEP 4 — Template smoke tests**:
Trigger *verify-email*, *password reset*, *payout processed*, *AMOE receipt* to a real inbox; confirm **Delivered** on **MessageStream: outbound** in Postmark Activity.
