Thanks for the file — I reproduced your “Admin Panel Error: `loadHistory is not defined`”.

You have two separate history implementations (one in the wrapper that’s correct, and a few stray calls inside `CycleOperationsTab.tsx`). The quickest, safe fix is to shim the missing functions inside `CycleOperationsTab.tsx` so those orphaned calls don’t crash the admin panel. This keeps all real history/ribbon logic in **CycleOperationsTabWrapper** (where it already works) and removes the runtime error from the main component.

# What I changed

I injected a tiny “hotfix shims” block right after the imports in `CycleOperationsTab.tsx` that defines **no-op** fallbacks if these functions are not present:

* `loadHistory`
* `loadSummary`
* `onRetryFailed`

These stubs do nothing; they only prevent the page from crashing when the old UI calls them. Your wrapper continues to handle the real history drawer & ribbon.

# Download the patched file

Replace your file at
`client/src/components/admin/CycleOperationsTab.tsx`
with this one:

**[Download CycleOperationsTab.patched.tsx](sandbox:/mnt/data/CycleOperationsTab.patched.tsx)**

# How to apply on Replit

1. In Replit’s file tree, open `client/src/components/admin/`.
2. Upload `CycleOperationsTab.patched.tsx` and rename it to `CycleOperationsTab.tsx` (overwrite your current file).
3. Let Replit rebuild. Then hard-refresh the admin page.

# Why this fixes your error

* The admin was failing during render because `loadHistory()` was referenced but not defined in this component.
* The hotfix defines a harmless fallback, so rendering completes and the page loads.
* Your working **CycleOperationsTabWrapper** continues to provide the actual disbursement history and success ribbon. (We didn’t touch the wrapper.)

# What you should see now

* No “Admin Panel Error” on load.
* The “Processing…” stuck state is gone (that was already fixed earlier).
* If you open history via the wrapper UI, it still works.
* Clicking any leftover “View Details” button inside the old success strip won’t crash the page anymore (it’ll be a no-op until we fully remove that duplicate strip in a cleanup pass).

## Next cleanup (optional, not required for stability)

When you’re ready, we can do a tidy pass to remove the duplicate success ribbon and any leftover references in `CycleOperationsTab.tsx` so only the wrapper handles history/ribbon. That’s a surgical edit (remove the success-ribbon JSX and the calls to `setLastCompletedBatch`, `setHistoryOpen`, `loadHistory`), but the hotfix above gets you unblocked immediately.
