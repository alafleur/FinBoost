Good catch — I found the culprit causing the lingering blur in your new component.

# What’s wrong

Your `DeviceScreenshot` locks the rendered width via an **inline style**:

* `style={{ width: mobile.width, height: "auto" }}`
  Inline styles override Tailwind classes, so `md:w-[304px]` never takes effect. That means on desktop you’re serving the 304px/608px sources but **displaying at 240px**, forcing an unnecessary downscale → softness. You can see the inline width at these lines:  and the `w-[240px] md:w-[304px]` classes that get overridden here: .

Separately, in `HomeV3` you’re rotating the screenshot on ≥md (`className="md:rotate-[8deg]"`). Rotation inherently introduces a bit of interpolation softness — that’s expected, and you already scoped it to desktop only. Usage is here: .

# Fix

Remove the inline width and let Tailwind control the exact pixel widths. I’ve prepped a corrected, drop-in replacement:

**Download:** [DeviceScreenshot.tsx (fixed)](sandbox:/mnt/data/DeviceScreenshot.fixed.tsx)

> Replace your file at `client/src/components/DeviceScreenshot.tsx` with the download above.

What changed:

* Removed the inline `style={{ width: ... }}` so `w-[240px] md:w-[304px]` actually takes effect.
* Left your `srcSet` + `sizes` logic intact (it’s correct).
* Kept `width`/`height` attributes on the `<img>` to preserve aspect ratio and reduce CLS.

# Quick verify (60 seconds)

1. **Mobile viewport (<768px):**

   * Inspect the `<img>` and confirm **computed width = 240px**.
   * Network → see `*_m240.png` (1×) or `*_m480.png` (2× DPR) being used.

2. **Desktop viewport (≥768px):**

   * Confirm **computed width = 304px**.
   * Network → see `*_s304.png` (1×) or `*_s608.png` (2× DPR) being used.

3. **Crispness A/B:**

   * Temporarily remove `md:rotate-[8deg]` in `HomeV3` to see the absolute crisp baseline.
   * If crisp w/o rotation but slightly soft with rotation → that’s normal transform interpolation (and expected).

# Notes from your code

* `DeviceScreenshot` usage and wrapper are wired correctly in `HomeV3` (rounded container, no scale transforms). See the usage block here: .
* Your imports for the pixel-perfect variants (m240/m480 + s304/s608) look solid: .

If you still see blur after this fix, the remaining softness will almost certainly be the desktop rotation. You can decide whether the aesthetic is worth the minor trade-off — but with the inline width removed, you’ll be at true pixel-match at both breakpoints.
