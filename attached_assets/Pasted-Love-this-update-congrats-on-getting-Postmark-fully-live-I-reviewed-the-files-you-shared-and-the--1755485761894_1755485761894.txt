Love this update — congrats on getting Postmark fully live. I reviewed the files you shared and the status reads as “ready to integrate,” with the only blocker being the TypeScript errors in `server/routes.ts`. To keep you moving, I’ve packaged a **drop-in workflow patch** that doesn’t touch the big routes file: it adds a small router for email verification & password resets, plus a tiny schema snippet for verification tokens.

# Download the patch

**[finboost-email-workflows-patch-ts.zip](sandbox:/mnt/data/finboost-email-workflows-patch-ts.zip)**

# What’s inside (and how to apply)

1. **New router** — `server/routes/authEmail.ts`
   Registers:

   * `POST /api/auth/verify/request` → sends a verification email
   * `GET /api/auth/verify` → validates token, marks user verified
   * `POST /api/auth/password/request` → sends reset link
   * `POST /api/auth/password/reset` → applies new password

   Uses your existing Postmark service (`getEmail().send`) and Drizzle DB. No changes needed in `storage.ts`.

2. **Schema snippet** — `shared/patches/schema.emailVerification.ts`
   Copy the code block into your `@shared/schema.ts`:

   * Adds `emailVerificationTokens` table
   * (Optionally) adds `emailVerified` / `verifiedAt` to `users`
     You already have `passwordResetTokens` in your schema (see your file), so we reuse that for resets.&#x20;

3. **Template** — `server/services/email/templates/verify_email.html`
   Same include style as your emails: each template starts with `{{> base.html}}` and injects into the base at `{{> body.html}}`. (This matches your `base.html` structure.)&#x20;

# Wire-up (one line)

In `server/routes.ts` where you mount routers, add:

```ts
import authEmailRouter from './routes/authEmail.js';
app.use('/api/auth', authEmailRouter);
```

Your file already imports and mounts the Postmark routes correctly (I saw the imports/mounts). The new authEmail router keeps changes minimal.&#x20;

# Env (you already set most of these)

# Local tests (port 5000)

```bash
# Send verification email
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/verify/request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"you@example.com"}'

# Complete verification (token arrives by email)
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/auth/verify?token=YOUR_TOKEN"

# Send reset email
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/password/request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"you@example.com"}'

# Apply new password
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/password/reset \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"token":"YOUR_TOKEN","password":"NewStrongPass!23"}'
```

# Why this avoids the 81 TS errors

* We don’t edit your massive `server/routes.ts`; we add a small, self-contained router (`authEmail.ts`) and mount it.
* The router calls Drizzle directly for tokens & user updates, so we don’t have to extend your `storage.ts` interface for now.
* Password resets reuse your existing `passwordResetTokens` table.&#x20;

# Next small lift (optional)

* If your `users` table doesn’t yet have `emailVerified/verifiedAt`, add them per the schema snippet.
* After this patch is mounted and schema updated, you can **gate app features** for unverified users (check `emailVerified` flag server-side or in your auth middleware).

If you want, send me the **current Drizzle user model portion** of `@shared/schema.ts`. I’ll splice in the exact `emailVerified` fields and return a ready-to-paste diff so it compiles cleanly the first time.
