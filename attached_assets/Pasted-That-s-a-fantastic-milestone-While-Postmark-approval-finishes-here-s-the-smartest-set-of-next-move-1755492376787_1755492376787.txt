That’s a fantastic milestone. While Postmark approval finishes, here’s the smartest set of next moves you can ship right now — I also included a ready-to-drop kit for webhook ingestion + suppressions.

# What to do next (in order)

1. **Wire verification into signup** (if not already)

   * After creating a user, trigger `POST /api/auth/verify/request` with their email.
   * Gate key actions behind `emailVerified`.

2. **Add observability + safety**

   * Ingest Postmark events (Delivery, Bounce, SpamComplaint) and **auto-suppress** marketing to bounced/complaint addresses.
   * Keep transactional flowing even if suppressed; you decide policy later.

3. **Admin visibility**

   * Quick admin endpoints to list recent email events and current suppressions.

4. **(Already in motion) Payout emails**

   * You’ve integrated the send; once approval lands you’ll have end-to-end notification.

# Drop-in kit: Webhook ingestion + suppressions

**[Download: finboost-email-webhook-suppressions.zip](sandbox:/mnt/data/finboost-email-webhook-suppressions.zip)**

### What’s inside

* `server/routes/postmarkWebhook.enhanced.ts`
  Enhanced webhook route that records events and suppresses on **HardBounce** / **SpamComplaint**.
* `server/services/email/suppressions.ts`
  Helpers to record events, upsert suppressions, check suppression status, and basic list queries.
* `shared/patches/schema.emailEvents.ts`
  Drizzle tables: `email_events` (full payload log) and `email_suppressions` (marketing-only blocklist).
* `server/routes/adminEmail.ts` *(optional)*

  * `GET /api/admin/email/events?limit=50&offset=0&type=Bounce&email=user@x.com`
  * `GET /api/admin/email/suppressions?limit=50&offset=0&search=@domain.com`

### How to wire it (2 mins)

1. **Schema**

   * Copy `shared/patches/schema.emailEvents.ts` into `@shared/schema.ts`.
   * Run a migration to create the two tables.

2. **Mount routes**

   ```ts
   import postmarkWebhookEnhanced from './routes/postmarkWebhook.enhanced.js';
   app.use('/api/webhooks/postmark', postmarkWebhookEnhanced);

   // Optional admin read-only
   import adminEmailRouter from './routes/adminEmail.js';
   app.use('/api/admin/email', adminEmailRouter);
   ```

3. **(Optional) Marketing guard**

   * Before sending **marketing** messages, call `isSuppressed(email)` from `server/services/email/suppressions.ts`.
   * Leave transactional as-is.

If you want, I can also:

* add a tiny “Email Events” panel to your admin UI, or
* output a Drizzle migration file tailored to your exact schema file names, or
* wire the verification trigger directly into your signup handler (paste me that function and I’ll return a patched file).
