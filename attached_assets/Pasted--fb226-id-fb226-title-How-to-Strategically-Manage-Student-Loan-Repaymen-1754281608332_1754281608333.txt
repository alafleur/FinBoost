Choosing the right plan depends on your income stability, interest rate, loan type, and life goals. Whether you aim to pay off aggressively or optimize forgiveness, the key is to understand your options and build around them.</p><h3>Strategic Approaches</h3><ul><li><strong>Standard Repayment</strong>: 10-year fixed, lower interest cost but higher monthly payments.</li><li><strong>Income-Driven Repayment (IDR)</strong>: Aligns payments with income, can enable forgiveness after 20–25 years.</li><li><strong>Aggressive payoff</strong>: Useful for high-income earners with manageable balances—reduces lifetime interest.</li><li><strong>Snowball vs Avalanche</strong>: Snowball pays smallest balances first (psychological wins); Avalanche pays highest interest first (financial efficiency).</li></ul><p>Make sure to revisit your plan annually—especially after life changes.</p>",
