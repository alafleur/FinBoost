Thanks for the nudge — I’ve packaged the cleaned-up, split hero as a single drop-in file you can download and use right away.

**What’s in this version**

* Real split layout: gradient “Learn Real Finance” on the left, “Earn Real Cash” on the right, phone screenshot centered.
* Pixel-perfect image rendering (240 px mobile / 304 px desktop) with proper `srcSet` (2× assets used automatically on retina).
* No placeholders or synthetic numbers.
* Calm spacing + subtle vertical glow divider behind the phone.
* Keeps your brand gradient on the left headline; strong slate headline on the right.
* Minimal CSS assumptions (pure Tailwind classes). No `motion`/scale animations that could blur images.

**Download the file**

* [Download `HeroSplit.tsx`](sandbox:/mnt/data/HeroSplit.tsx)

**Where to place**
Put this file where your other sections live (e.g., `client/src/pages/sections/HeroSplit.tsx` or similar), then import and render it in `HomeV3.tsx` (or your page component):

```tsx
import HeroSplit from "./HeroSplit";

export default function HomeV3() {
  return (
    <>
      <HeroSplit />
      {/* rest of the page */}
    </>
  );
}
```

**Asset expectations**
This component imports your existing crisp assets:

```
@assets/screenshots/step1_m240.png   // 240×431
@assets/screenshots/step1_m480.png   // 480×862
@assets/screenshots/step1_s304.png   // 304×547
@assets/screenshots/step1_s608.png   // 608×1094
```

If your alias differs, just tweak the import paths at the top.

**Why this should fix the remaining pain points**

* The phone image is **never** scaled off its designed widths (240 / 304), so there’s no browser resampling blur.
* `sizes` guides the browser to pick the correct asset; retina devices will grab the 2× automatically.
* The hero spacing is deliberate (no cramped feel; more white space for authority).
* Typography hierarchy matches the Underdog-style confidence without being a copy.

If you want me to inline this into your existing `HomeV3.tsx` for you, paste that file here and I’ll merge it carefully without touching anything else.
