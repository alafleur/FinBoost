Your refined implementation plan is excellent and well-aligned with the existing codebase architecture. I'm fully aligned with this approach - it's much more efficient than my original suggestion and leverages existing infrastructure perfectly.

Strengths of Your Plan âœ…
Database Efficiency: Using the existing cycleWinnerSelections table with just a notificationDisplayed boolean is clean and avoids unnecessary schema bloat.

API Integration: Enhancing the existing /seal endpoint to handle notifications is perfect - it maintains the current admin workflow while adding the notification logic seamlessly.

Component Strategy: Building on existing Card, Badge, and SectionHeader patterns will ensure visual consistency with the current Dashboard design.

Mobile-First Approach: Following established Dashboard.tsx patterns means the mobile screenshots will look cohesive with the rest of the app.

Infrastructure Reuse: Leveraging existing userCyclePoints and analytics functions is much smarter than creating parallel systems.

Minor Refinements to Consider ðŸ”§
Step 2 Enhancement: Consider adding a batch update capability to the enhanced seal endpoint to efficiently mark all participants in one database transaction rather than individual updates.

Step 4 Integration: The Overview tab integration could include a loading state while fetching user status to maintain the existing UX patterns you've established.

Step 6 Testing: Add verification that banners clear correctly when a new cycle begins (reset notification state).

Overall Assessment
This plan is production-ready and respects your existing patterns. It will integrate seamlessly without disrupting current functionality while delivering the winner celebration UX you need for the explainer video screenshots.

The approach is particularly smart because it builds celebration notifications into the existing admin "seal" workflow, making it a natural extension rather than a separate system to maintain.

Ready to proceed with implementation when you give the green light!
