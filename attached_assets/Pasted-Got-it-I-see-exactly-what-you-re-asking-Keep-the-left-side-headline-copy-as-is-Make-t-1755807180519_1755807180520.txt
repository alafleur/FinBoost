Got it—I see exactly what you’re asking:

* Keep the left side (headline + copy) as-is ✅
* Make the **right side** look like the earlier version: **no phone frame**, soft drop-shadow, **vertical subject tags** on the left of the screenshot, and the **ticket bubble** at the bottom-right ✅
* On **mobile**, put the **headline before the screenshot** ✅

I’ve made a **surgical** update that does only that, without touching the rest of the page.

# What I changed (precisely)

* Replaced the internals of the `HeroLearnToEarn` component so the **right side** matches your original design (no frame, tags, ticket bubble).
* Enforced mobile ordering (**text first**, screenshot second) with `order-1` / `order-2`.
* Kept our pixel-perfect image approach to stay razor-sharp (exact 240/304 CSS widths + width-based `srcSet`, no scale animations).

# Drop-in file (ready to use)

I generated a drop-in component you can place into your repo:

**Path:** `client/src/components/HeroLearnToEarn.tsx`
This is the only file you need to replace. Your current `HomeV3.tsx` already imports and uses it correctly (so no other edits required).&#x20;

**Download:**
[Download the patch zip](sandbox:/mnt/data/finboost-hero-patch.zip)

Inside the zip:

* `client/src/components/HeroLearnToEarn.tsx` – the updated component
* `README.md` – 30-second apply steps

# Notes to Replit (context + why this fixes RHS)

* The screenshot is rendered **without a frame**, with a soft shadow and glow.
* **Subject tags** (Budget, Credit, Savings, Investing, Debt) are absolutely positioned along the left rail.
* The **ticket bubble** sits bottom-right of the screenshot.
* **Crispness is preserved**: the image uses fixed CSS widths (`w-[240px]` mobile, `w-[304px]` desktop) and width-based `srcSet` (240w/304w + 480w/608w for retina). There are **no scale transforms**, so the browser never resamples.

# Verification checklist

* **Mobile:** headline appears **above** the screenshot (it will; `order-1` vs `order-2`).
* **Right side:** visually matches your earlier iteration (tags + ticket bubble + no frame).
* **Crispness:** in DevTools, confirm rendered width **240px** (mobile) / **304px** (desktop) and that `currentSrc` chooses the matching **240w/304w** (or **480w/608w** on retina).

If you want more (or fewer) subject tags, edit the `TAGS` array at the top of the component—no other changes needed.
