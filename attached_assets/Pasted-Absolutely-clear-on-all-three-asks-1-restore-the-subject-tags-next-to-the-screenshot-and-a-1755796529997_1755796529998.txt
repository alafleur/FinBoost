Absolutely—clear on all three asks:

1. restore the **subject tags** next to the screenshot (and add a couple more)
2. use the **frameless screenshot + soft shadow** look (no phone bezel) with a **ticket** overlay
3. fix **mobile order** so the **headline comes first**, then the screenshot

I made a careful, surgical update that only touches the hero and keeps everything else intact.

# What I changed (precisely)

* Re-implemented the right side to match the earlier look:

  * **Angled blue accent** behind the image
  * **Subject chips** (Budget, Credit, Savings, Investing, Debt) stacked on the side
  * **Ticket** overlay badge (small, tasteful, bottom-right)
  * **Frameless** screenshot with **soft shadow** (keeps the crispness)
* Preserved the **pixel-perfect srcSet/sizes** image pipeline (240/480, 304/608) to avoid any blur.
* Ensured **single component** for desktop/mobile:

  * On mobile, text column is `order-1` and image column is `order-2` → **headline appears before the screenshot**.
* Styling remains consistent with your **blue/indigo** scheme; no new dependencies.

# Download (drop-in)

I packaged a ready-to-drop file:

**Hero component**

* `client/src/components/HeroLearnToEarn.tsx` — default export, same name/path you’re already using.

**Zip download**

* [Download the patch](sandbox:/mnt/data/finboost_hero_patch.zip)

This zip contains:

* `client/src/components/HeroLearnToEarn.tsx`
* `README.txt` (exact wiring notes)

# How to wire (1-minute check)

HomeV3 already passes the phone sources; just ensure it looks like this:

```tsx
<HeroLearnToEarn
  phone={{
    m240: screenshots[0].m240,   // 240×431
    m480: screenshots[0].m480,   // 480×862
    s304: screenshots[0].s304,   // 304×547
    s608: screenshots[0].s608,   // 608×1094
    alt: screenshots[0].title,
  }}
/>
```

If your import path is different, place the file under `client/src/components/` and update the import accordingly.

# Notes / expected result

* **Desktop**: left column headline/subcopy/CTAs; **right** shows the **frameless** screenshot with angled accent, **subject chips**, and **ticket overlay**—matching the earlier version you liked (plus extra subjects).
* **Mobile**: headline first, screenshot second.
* **Crisp** screenshots maintained (no scaling blur).

If you want me to also add one or two more subject chips (e.g., “Insurance”, “Taxes”), say the word and I’ll expand the list.
