You‚Äôre right: auth is fixed, but `loadCycles()` isn‚Äôt running at all during init. Let‚Äôs prove it and make it bullet-proof.

# What‚Äôs happening (and where)

* `loadCycles()` is *intended* to run inside the initial `useEffect` via `Promise.allSettled([... , loadCycles().catch(...) ])`. You can see it in the init bundle here.&#x20;
* The `loadCycles` function exists further down and sets `winnerCycles` when the API returns.&#x20;
* The Admin component does mount (wrapped in an `ErrorBoundary`).&#x20;

Given your logs (no `console.log` from the function, no `/api/admin/winner-cycles` traffic), the most likely culprit is the *invocation site*‚Äî`Promise.allSettled`‚Äîwhere a sync error in any element expression can short-circuit or a rejected promise is swallowed by the per-call `.catch`, masking the failure before your function body‚Äôs first log line.

# Minimal, surgical fixes

## 1) Add a ‚Äúnamed‚Äù results map so we can see exactly what ran

Replace the `Promise.allSettled` block with this safer harness that (a) logs each task by name, (b) *never* swallows a sync error silently, and (c) guarantees `loadCycles` actually executes.

```ts
const tasks: Record<string, () => Promise<any>> = {
  fetchData,
  fetchCycleSettings,
  fetchUserCyclePoints,
  fetchPendingProofs,
  fetchPointActions,
  fetchSupportTickets,
  fetchCyclePoolSettings,
  fetchCurrentPoolSettings,
  fetchCycleWinnerSelections,
  loadCycles, // <- the one we care about
};

const results = await Promise.allSettled(
  Object.entries(tasks).map(async ([name, fn]) => {
    console.log(`[init] starting ${name}`);
    try {
      const out = await fn();
      console.log(`[init] ${name} ‚úì`);
      return { name, status: 'fulfilled' as const, out };
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(`[init] ${name} ‚úó`, e);
      return { name, status: 'rejected' as const, reason: e };
    }
  })
);

// Pretty-print outcomes
results.forEach((r) => {
  // r is PromiseSettledResult<{name, status, ...}>
  if ((r as any).value) {
    const { name, status } = (r as any).value;
    console.log(`[init] result ${name}: ${status}`);
  } else {
    const { name } = (r as any).reason ?? { name: 'unknown' };
    console.log(`[init] result ${name}: rejected`);
  }
});
```

(You can drop this after debugging, but it will instantly tell you if `loadCycles` actually ran.)

## 2) Add a can‚Äôt-miss log at the very top of `loadCycles()`

You already added rich logs in the `(1)` file. Keep the very first line as:

```ts
console.log('üîÑ loadCycles() ENTER');
```

The function definition we‚Äôre touching is this one.&#x20;

## 3) Call `loadCycles()` once more *after* the batch as a belt-and-suspenders fallback

Right after the `Promise.allSettled` block, add:

```ts
if (winnerCycles.length === 0) {
  console.log('[init] winnerCycles empty after batch; forcing direct loadCycles()');
  try { await loadCycles(); } catch (e) { console.error('direct loadCycles failed', e); }
}
```

This ensures a single missed execution doesn‚Äôt hide the section.

## 4) Quick dependency sanity checks

* `toast` exists in this scope (it does: `useToast()` at top of component), so it won‚Äôt throw.
* `setWinnerCycles` is defined before `loadCycles` uses it (it is).
* The init effect is there and runs once on mount.&#x20;

# Why this works

* If `loadCycles()` was being rejected or never invoked within the `Promise.allSettled` array, the named harness will print a line for it (‚Äústarting loadCycles‚Äù), and either a ‚úì or the precise error. No more silent failure.
* Even in the worst case, the post-batch direct call guarantees we populate `winnerCycles`, which mounts the whole **Winner Selection Cycles** section (and your **Process PayPal Disbursements** button).

# Acceptance criteria (what you should see)

* Console:

  * `[init] starting loadCycles`
  * `üîÑ loadCycles() ENTER`
  * `üåê Making API call to /api/admin/winner-cycles` (from your function logs)
* Network: a GET to `/api/admin/winner-cycles`
* UI: ‚ÄúWinner Selection Cycles‚Äù shows your **July 2/2 Test Cycle** with the green **Selection Complete** badge and the blue **Process PayPal Disbursements** button.

If you want, I can also factor a tiny `run(name, fn)` helper so every future init call gets the same robust logging/handling.
