Revise the existing landing page to reflect a hybrid reward model based on tiers and Tribe Points, where:
•	Users earn points by engaging (e.g. learning, referrals, uploads)
•	Each month, users are split into 3 tiers based on points
•	50% of users in each tier are randomly selected to receive cash rewards
•	More than 50% of all membership fees go back into the monthly rewards pool
Keep the design sleek, modern, and trustworthy — avoid scammy or overly “lottery” vibes.

✅ CHANGES TO IMPLEMENT
1. 🧠 Updated Hero Section (Top of Page)
Headline:
“Turn Financial Stress Into Financial Progress — Together.”
Subheadline:
Join a collective of members working to improve their financial lives. Learn, take action, and earn Tribe Points. Each month, members in all tiers are rewarded from a growing pool of cash bonuses — no matter your starting point.
CTA Button:
Join the Waitlist
Small text below CTA:
Membership is $19.99/month. Over half of every dollar goes directly back to members as monthly rewards.

2. 📊 NEW SECTION: “How the Rewards Work”
Use a simple 3-step visual breakdown of the reward system:
________________________________________
💸 How the Rewards Work
🪙 Earn Points
Complete tutorials, quizzes, refer others, and upload proof of good financial behavior like debt repayment or investing.
📊 Climb the Tiers
Each month, members are placed into 3 tiers (Top / Middle / Bottom) based on their Points.
🎉 Get Rewarded
50% of users in every tier are randomly selected to receive cash bonuses. Higher tiers = larger pool shares.
Pool Distribution:
•	Top Tier = 50% of rewards pool
•	Middle Tier = 35%
•	Bottom Tier = 15%
Even casual members have a chance. The more you engage, the better your odds and payout size.

3. 📈 Add a Graphic: “As We Grow, So Do the Rewards”
Simple visual showing example growth of the collective pool:
Members	Monthly Reward Pool
1,000	~$10,000
5,000	~$50,000
10,000	~$100,000+
Accompany with this note:
The more members who join, the bigger the monthly pool — and the greater your potential payout.

4. 🔄 Update “How It Works” Section (Condensed Version)
You can simplify the old How It Works section into 4 steps:
1.	Become a Member
Join for $19.99/month — over half of your fee goes directly to the collective rewards pool.
2.	Earn Points
Learn, refer friends, and show real-life action to boost your standing.
3.	Get Matched to a Tier
Every month, you're placed into one of 3 tiers based on points.
4.	Qualify for Rewards
Half of each tier gets randomly selected for monthly cash rewards. More points = higher tier = bigger slice.
