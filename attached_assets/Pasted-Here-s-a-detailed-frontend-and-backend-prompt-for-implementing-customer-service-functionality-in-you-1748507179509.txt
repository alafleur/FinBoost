Here's a detailed frontend and backend prompt for implementing customer service functionality in your FinBoost app using Replit:

🔧 Prompt for Replit: Implement Customer Support Functionality (Frontend + Backend)
📘 Overview:
Implement a full-stack customer support system that allows users to submit inquiries, which are saved to a backend endpoint for admin review. The system should be accessible via a /support page and designed for responsiveness and usability.

🖥️ Frontend Requirements
Support Page: /support

Create a page with a form that includes the following fields:

Full Name (text, required)

Email Address (text, required, validate email format)

Category (dropdown: General Inquiry, Billing, Technical Issue, Feedback)

Message (textarea, required, minimum 20 characters)

(Optional) File Upload (image or PDF, optional)

Functionality:

Form validation with error messaging for incomplete or invalid entries.

On submission, send a POST request to /api/support with form data as JSON.

Show success message (e.g., "Thank you! We’ve received your request.")

Use Tailwind CSS or existing UI style for form elements and layout.

🗂️ Backend Requirements
Route: POST /api/support

Accept JSON payload with the form data: name, email, category, message (and file if applicable).

Validate fields (basic backend validation).

Save the data to a mock database:

Option 1: Append to a JSON file (supportMessages.json)

Option 2: Use in-memory array if persistence is not needed

Log the request to the console for verification.

Route: GET /api/support (for future admin access)

Return a list of submitted support messages (mock admin view)

Connect to an email service like SendGrid or Mailgun to email admins a copy.

Include a “Need Help?” button floating on all pages linking to /support.
