📊 Add Graphic: Rewards Pool Growth (Illustrative)
Add a simple chart or dynamic graphic below the hero showing how the collective reward pool grows with users:

5,000 members → $50,000 pool

10,000 members → $100,000+

Use a progress bar or vertical ladder with sample rewards tiers.

🧠 “How It Works” Section — Revamp
Replace current steps with:

Join as a Member
For $19.99/month, you get access to tools that reward your financial progress — and over half of your fee goes back to the community.

Earn Points
Complete bite-sized lessons and quizzes, refer friends, and upload proof of financial action like debt payoff or investing.

Qualify for Rewards
Each month, the top 50% of members by points earn cash rewards — the higher your points, the bigger your tier.

Power the Collective
More members = a larger rewards pool for all. Help the community grow while growing your financial potential.

💬 Replace “Win” with Merit-Based Language
Wherever “win” or “chance to win” appears, use:

“Qualify for”

“Earn”

“Receive cash rewards based on merit”

“Get rewarded for real progress”
