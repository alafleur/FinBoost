Phase 1 Analysis Complete - Detailed Findings
1. API Endpoint Investigation:
✅ API endpoint /api/admin/winner-cycles EXISTS and is properly implemented (lines 3018-3040 in server/routes.ts)
✅ Endpoint returns correct response format: { success: true, cycles: [...] }
✅ Authentication requirements: Requires Bearer token + admin email verification
✅ Database query structure: Selects from winnerSelectionCycles table ordered by createdAt DESC

2. API Endpoint Implementation Details:
Route: GET /api/admin/winner-cycles
Authentication: Bearer token + email check (lafleur.andrew@gmail.com)
Database table: winnerSelectionCycles
Response format: { success: true, cycles: CycleData[] }
Error handling: Proper try/catch with detailed logging
3. Frontend Data Loading Analysis:
❌ CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED: loadCycles() function is NOT CALLED in initial data loading
✅ loadCycles() function EXISTS and is correctly implemented (lines 1571-1584)
✅ Function structure: Proper token handling, API call, and state update (setWinnerCycles)

4. Root Cause Confirmation:
The useEffect hook on lines 676-714 calls these functions for initial data loading:

fetchData() ✅
fetchCycleSettings() ✅
fetchUserCyclePoints() ✅
fetchPendingProofs() ✅
fetchPointActions() ✅
fetchSupportTickets() ✅
fetchCyclePoolSettings() ✅
fetchCurrentPoolSettings() ✅
fetchCycleWinnerSelections() ✅
BUT loadCycles() is MISSING ❌

5. Database Status:
❌ No existing winnerSelectionCycles records found in database
✅ Database schema exists and is properly structured

6. UI Structure Verification:
✅ "Winner Selection Cycles" section EXISTS (lines 5242-5296)
✅ Conditional rendering logic: Only shows when winnerCycles.length > 0
✅ PayPal disbursement button EXISTS in "Selected Cycle Actions" (lines 5345+)

7. Expected Flow:
User loads Admin portal → useEffect triggers loadInitialData()
loadInitialData() should call loadCycles()
loadCycles() makes API call to /api/admin/winner-cycles
API returns empty array (no cycles exist yet)
UI shows "No winner cycles created yet" message
BUT: Step 2 is broken - loadCycles() is never called
8. Authentication Issue:
⚠️ Secondary Issue: Console shows 403 error when testing endpoint manually, indicating potential token/auth issues that need verification

Phase 1 Summary:
The issue is a missing function call in the initial data loading sequence. The loadCycles() function exists and is properly implemented, but it's never executed because it's not included in the loadInitialData() function's API call array. This is a simple but critical oversight causing the entire "Winner Selection Cycles" section to remain hidden.
