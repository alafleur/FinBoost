Absolutely — here’s a clean and professional message summarizing the feedback on Phase 1 and Phase 2, ready to pass along to Replit:

Subject: Feedback on Phase 1 & 2 Implementation – HomeV3.tsx

Hi team — I reviewed the Phase 1 and 2 updates to HomeV3.tsx and appreciate the progress. Here's detailed feedback on what's working well and what needs refinement before moving to Phase 3:


---

✅ What’s Working Well

Phase 1:

The previous "Rewards Breakdown" section (id="rewards") has been cleanly removed.

The overall page structure remains intact and flows smoothly.


Phase 2:

The "How It Works (and How You Win)" section is now condensed to 3 steps.

The layout is responsive and stacked properly for mobile.

Screenshot placeholders have been added for each step.

⚠️ Requested Refinements Before Phase 3

1. Screenshot Styling & Captions

Add proper image sizing/styling for consistency across steps.

Use meaningful file paths for screenshots when ready (e.g., from /assets/).

Captions should be clearly styled and easy to distinguish beneath each image — consider consistent font size, spacing, and subdued color styling.



2. Visual Consistency

Make sure each 3-step card uses consistent padding (p-4, md:p-6), border-radius (rounded-2xl), and optional hover effects (hover:shadow-lg) to match other sections.

Double-check vertical spacing between image, heading, and body text.

Ensure image alignment and scaling works cleanly across all devices.



3. Maintain Placeholder for Phase 3

Please leave a comment or space in the file (e.g., // TODO: Insert leaderboard example here) so we have a placeholder to cleanly insert the leaderboard examples and tier reward explanation next.





---

Once these refinements are addressed, we can proceed to Phase 3, which will add the leaderboard proof (Sarah/Alex/Mike example) and finalize the reward mechanics explanation.

Thanks again — let me know if any part needs clarification.

Let me know if you want me to send a follow-up version for Phase 3 when ready.
