Here’s a Replit-ready prompt to add a daily streak point incentive system to your FinBoost app. This will guide the developer to implement logic, UI components, and database updates to track and reward user streaks:

🛠️ Replit Prompt: Daily Streak Point Incentive System
Objective: Add a daily streak system to FinBoost that rewards users with bonus points for logging in and completing a lesson or quiz each day. Users should see their current streak and be notified of bonuses.

⚙️ Functional Requirements
1. Streak Tracking

Track the number of consecutive days a user completes a learning activity.

Reset the streak if a user misses a day.

Store in the database: currentStreak, lastActivityDate, longestStreak.

2. Bonus Points System

Reward bonus XP based on streak:

Day 1: +0 XP (just starting)

Day 2-4: +5 XP/day

Day 5-6: +10 XP/day

Day 7+: +15 XP/day

XP bonus should be added when a user completes a lesson or quiz.

3. Frontend Display

Add a streak tracker widget to the dashboard (e.g., fire emoji 🔥 with number of days).

Show tooltips or text like:

“🔥 3-day streak! Keep it up for more rewards.”

“You earned +10 XP for maintaining your streak!”

On missed day: “Your streak reset. Start again tomorrow!”

4. Notification System

Show a toast/popup after each learning activity: “Streak updated! +10 XP bonus added.”

Optional: Daily push/email notification to remind user to log in.

💾 Database Schema Updates
User Model (extend existing schema):

ts
Copy
Edit
streak: {
  current: number,
  longest: number,
  lastActivityDate: string, // ISO format
}
🧪 Logic Suggestions (Backend)
Run a check on lessonCompletion or quizCompletion:

If last activity was yesterday, increment streak.

If today is first activity of the day, give streak reward.

If more than 1 day missed, reset streak to 1.

Update current, longest, and lastActivityDate.
