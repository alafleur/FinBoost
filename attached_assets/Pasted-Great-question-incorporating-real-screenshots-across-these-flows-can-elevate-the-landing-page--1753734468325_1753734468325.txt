Great question — incorporating **real screenshots** across these flows can elevate the landing page dramatically. Here’s a breakdown of how they impact both the **"How It Works"** section and the **"Platform Overview"** section — along with implementation suggestions:

---

## 🧩 Impact on **How It Works** Section

### ✅ Shift from Explanation → Demonstration

Once you include screenshots of:

* A **lesson module**
* A **completed lesson**
* A **debt paydown submission**
* The **leaderboard**
* The **reward disbursement page**

…the section becomes **much more visual** and **trust-building**.

---

### 🔄 Suggested Adjustments:

#### 1. **Split the 3 steps into tabs or collapsible cards**

Each step could have:

* **Short title + 1-line description**
* A **real screenshot underneath** (maybe modal-expandable on click)

This helps:

* Avoid overwhelming the user
* Keep mobile usability high
* Let users skim, then dive into details visually

#### 2. **Use captions on each screenshot**

Clearly label what’s shown, e.g.:

> *“Complete short lessons like this and earn 20 points.”*
> *“Verified debt paydown = up to 100 bonus points.”*

#### 3. **Optional**: Add a short subheader like:

> *“Here’s what it actually looks like to earn, learn, and win”*

## 🧭 Impact on **Platform Overview** Section

### ✅ From Abstract → Tangible

The Platform Overview currently helps explain core mechanics. Once you have visuals of each key function, you can shift from describing features to **showcasing them**.

### 🔄 Suggested Reframe:

Rather than just a bullet-based overview, consider this layout:

| Feature                  | Visual                                    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 Learn & Quiz          | Lesson module screenshot                  |
| ✅ Complete & Track       | Lesson completion confirmation screenshot |
| 💸 Submit Debt Paydown   | Debt submission form screenshot           |
| 📊 Climb the Leaderboard | Live leaderboard screenshot               |
| 🏆 Win Cash              | Rewards payout screenshot                 |

* Format this either as a **horizontal scroll** (carousel) or as a **stacked grid** (mobile-optimized).

### ✍️ Optional Copy to Lead It Off:

> **Everything you do inside FinBoost earns you points. Here's what that looks like:**

## 📌 Overall Value of Screenshots

Adding real screenshots:

* Builds **trust** and visual **credibility**
* Helps differentiate FinBoost from vague “finance app” competitors
* Lets users *picture themselves* in the flow → huge for conversions
