Yep — I agree with Replit’s diagnosis. Your `Admin.tsx` had **duplicate/malformed tab sections** and a big block of **orphaned JSX** inside the Cycles and Cycle-Ops areas. That’s exactly why you see “Expected corresponding JSX closing tag…” errors and startup failures. I’ve done a **surgical fix**:

* **Cycles tab** (`value="cycles"`): replaced the broken block with a clean, minimal section that renders the correct component.
* **Duplicate Cycle-Ops tab** (`value="cycle-operations"`): removed the **second** duplicate block entirely (kept the first one).
* Left your new **Disbursement History** page as-is; it compiles cleanly.&#x20;

Below are the **downloadable, ready-to-drop-in files** + quick wiring notes.

### ✅ Downloads

**Patched Admin.tsx (fixes malformed JSX & duplicate tab)**

* [Download `Admin.patched.cycles-and-ops.tsx`](sandbox:/mnt/data/Admin.patched.cycles-and-ops.tsx)
  *Replace your `client/src/pages/Admin.tsx` with this (rename to `Admin.tsx`).*
  (Patched based on your uploaded file.)&#x20;

**DisbursementHistory.tsx (full page)**

* [Download `DisbursementHistory.tsx`](sandbox:/mnt/data/DisbursementHistory.tsx)
  *Place at `client/src/components/admin/DisbursementHistory.tsx`.*
  (This is the same, working page we added earlier.)&#x20;

> If you already placed `DisbursementHistory.tsx` in that path, you don’t need to replace it again.

### What I changed (Admin.tsx)

* **Cycles tab reset** to a clean, valid block:

  ```tsx
  <TabsContent value="cycles">
    <CycleManagementTab />
  </TabsContent>
  ```
* **Removed the duplicate** `value="cycle-operations"` block that was causing tag mismatches.
* Left the **Disbursements tab** you already patched to:

  ```tsx
  <TabsContent value={TAB_DISBURSEMENTS}>
    <DisbursementHistory />
  </TabsContent>
  ```

These changes eliminate the unmatched `</div>`, `</Card>`, `</CardContent>` and duplicated `<TabsContent>` issues reported by Replit.

### One-liner wiring check

Make sure `Admin.tsx` has the import for the new page:

```tsx
// If your @ alias is configured
import DisbursementHistory from "@/components/admin/DisbursementHistory";

// Otherwise use a relative path (adjust depth if needed)
// import DisbursementHistory from "../components/admin/DisbursementHistory";
```

Cycle components are already imported in your file (as seen in your upload), so no changes needed there.&#x20;

### After dropping in the files

1. Replace `client/src/pages/Admin.tsx` with the downloaded **Admin.patched.cycles-and-ops.tsx** (rename to `Admin.tsx`).
2. Ensure `client/src/components/admin/DisbursementHistory.tsx` exists (download above if needed).
3. Restart the frontend dev server (Vite) and hard-refresh the browser.

You should now have:

* A **stable Admin page** that compiles and loads.
* A clean **Cycles** tab.
* A single **Cycle-Operations** tab.
* A dedicated **Disbursement History** section (no more drawer), reachable via your Disbursements tab.
