explain why stats are needed? they seem generic and im not sure why the affects a potential user on an individual basis

Great question — and totally fair skepticism.

Stats aren’t always necessary, and bad ones can hurt more than help. But when used correctly, here’s why a few well-chosen data points can strengthen your message, especially for FinBoost’s positioning:

✅ 1. Establish Shared Reality
Stats like “64% live paycheck to paycheck” frame the problem as systemic, not personal failure.

This eases shame or inertia for the user.

It tells them: “You’re not broken. This system is.”

That creates psychological permission to act and join a movement.

✅ 2. Build Urgency Without Hype
You’re walking a fine line between credibility and excitement. Stats add weight to emotionally charged headlines.

Example:

“Drowning in debt? Anxious about retirement?”
→ That’s emotional.

Now support it with:

“64% live paycheck to paycheck. 57% of Gen Z has credit card debt. Only 23% feel confident about retirement.”

→ Now the user sees: “This isn’t just me feeling overwhelmed — this is a national crisis. And I want to be part of something addressing it.”

✅ 3. Legitimize the “Collective” Concept
Your pitch is partly:

“Let’s pool resources and build collective strength.”

Some users may feel skeptical:

“Why should I pool anything with strangers online?”

Stat framing like:

“Millions are facing the same challenge. Alone, we struggle. Together, we build power.”

...makes the collective model feel justified and rational, not utopian or niche.

✅ 4. Support Media/PR Hooks Later
Even if you don’t lead with stats on the page, including them helps support:

Press outreach

Creator/partner talking points

Paid ads or explainers

It shows you're grounded in the real-world financial landscape.

⚠️ But Be Careful…
Avoid overloading with stats — 1–2 max is ideal.

Avoid stats that don't evoke emotion or urgency (e.g. “20% don’t track budgets” = meh).

Don’t use stats just because — they should amplify the emotional hook, not replace it.

✍️ TL;DR
Use stats sparingly and strategically to:

Make users feel less alone

Support urgency without sounding hypey

Reinforce the legitimacy of your “collective power” model
