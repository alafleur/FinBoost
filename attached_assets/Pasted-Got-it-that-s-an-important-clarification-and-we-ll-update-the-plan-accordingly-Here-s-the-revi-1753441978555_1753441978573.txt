Got it — that’s an important clarification and we’ll update the plan accordingly.

Here’s the revised version:

---

## ✅ **Updated FinBoost Learning Module Plan**

**(for Replit and internal reference)**
**As of July 2025**

---

### 🎯 **Core Strategy**

FinBoost's educational modules are designed to be:

* **Culturally Relevant** – Inspired by real-time TikTok, Instagram, Reddit, and economic trends
* **Credible & Actionable** – Educational, myth-busting, behavior-focused
* **Gamified** – Connected to real-world actions and point rewards
* **Digestible** – Short-form, dynamic, TikTok-style format (3–5 minute reads)

---

### 🧱 **Module Structure**

Each module includes:

* A strong **hook** (relatable question, myth, or challenge)
* Structured HTML content (headings, bullets, tips, examples)
* A 3–4 question **quiz** (with correct answers and explanations)
* Optionally linked to **proof-based actions** for bonus points
* Default: **20 points per completed module**
* Estimated time: **5 minutes**

---

### 📦 **Cycle-Based Content System**

**Each cycle includes a full new batch of modules.**

* Volume: **10–20 new modules per cycle**
* Some content may **overlap in theme** with prior cycles, but each must offer a **fresh angle** or scenario
* Purpose: Keeps returning users engaged with **new, relevant content** every cycle (drives retention)

---

### 🧠 **Topic Development Approach**

Module topics are driven by:

* Real-world economic events (e.g. student loan changes, interest hikes)
* Social media trends (#DebtFreeJourney, “house poor”, debt snowball, investing myths)
* Recurring user pain points and misconceptions
* Timely, specific financial situations — *not* broad textbook topics

| Example Category | Sample Specific Modules                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Credit           | “Does Checking Your Score Actually Hurt It?”                  |
| Debt             | “How the Snowball Method Actually Works”                      |
| Real Estate      | “House Poor: What TikTok Gets Right (and Wrong)”              |
| Career           | “Salary Isn’t Everything — How to Compare Total Compensation” |

### 🔁 **Ongoing Expansion Plan**

* Content team will produce **10–20 new modules per 2-week cycle**
* Expansion guided by:

  * TikTok trend scans
  * Platform engagement patterns
  * Feedback from high-retention users
* Evergreen modules will also be archived or reused **with adjustments**, e.g., scenario tweaks, new quiz formats

---

### 🔧 **Replit Implementation Notes**

* Continue using current backend structure (HTML + quiz objects)
* Ensure ability to:

  * Batch-upload cycle-specific modules
  * Assign modules to a given cycle (metadata field or tag)
  * Archive past cycle content while preserving completion history
* Support optional **proof-of-action** uploads for bonus points
* Long-term: may incorporate **dynamic quizzes** or AI-generated variants for depth
