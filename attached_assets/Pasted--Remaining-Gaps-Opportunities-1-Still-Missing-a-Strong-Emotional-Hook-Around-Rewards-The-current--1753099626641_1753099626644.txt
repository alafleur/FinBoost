 Remaining Gaps / Opportunities
1. Still Missing a Strong Emotional Hook Around Rewards
The current tone is informative but doesn’t tap into the excitement or competitive drive that motivates fantasy sports or Underdog users.

✅ Suggestion:
Add language like:

“Compete. Win. Get paid.”

“Your progress isn’t just tracked — it’s rewarded.”

“Every cycle, real money rewards go to the top performers and active members.”

2. Still Needs a Standalone Rewards Section
You’re blending rewards info into other sections, but a dedicated section with visual focus would make the incentive clearer.

✅ Suggestion:
Insert a section titled:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-4">How Real People Win Real Rewards</h2>
With supporting bullets:

✅ Earn points for completing lessons and taking real actions

✅ Compete in 2-week cycles

✅ More than half of active members win cash prizes

✅ Top prizes can reach $500–$2,000

✅ FinBoost boosts prize pools during Early Access

3. Still No Visual Showing How Points → Rewards
There’s no visual bridge showing:

How users earn points

How those points translate into odds or tiers

How rewards are allocated

✅ Suggestion:
Use a 3-step visual layout:

Copy
Edit
📘 Learn → 📈 Earn Points → 🏆 Win Rewards
Or animate a mock cycle leaderboard:

User A: 240 pts → Tier 1 → Wins $500
User B: 110 pts → Tier 2 → Wins $75
User C: 10 pts → Tier 3 → Wins $10
✅ Summary of Recommendations to Pass to Replit
Here’s what to send Replit as a structured set of suggestions:

📌 Landing Page V3: Conversion Optimization Suggestions

“Earn real cash rewards for building real financial habits.”

Bullets:

Earn points from lessons, actions, and predictions
