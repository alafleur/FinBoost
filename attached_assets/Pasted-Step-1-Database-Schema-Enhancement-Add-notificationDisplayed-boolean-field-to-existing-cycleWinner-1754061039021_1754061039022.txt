Step 1: Database Schema Enhancement
Add notificationDisplayed boolean field to existing cycleWinnerSelections table
Leverage existing userCyclePoints table to identify all cycle participants
Use existing cycle analytics data for community stats (no new tables needed)
Step 2: Backend API Enhancements
Enhance existing /api/admin/cycle-winner-selection/${cycleId}/seal endpoint to:
Mark all participants with winner/non-winner status using batch database transaction
Handle potential timeout scenarios for large user bases with proper error responses
Set notificationDisplayed: false for all affected users in single operation
Calculate community stats using existing analytics functions
Return confirmation of notification setup completion with participant counts
Create /api/cycles/current/user-status endpoint to return:
User's winner status for current cycle
Community achievement stats (total distributed, number of winners)
Whether notification has been displayed
Handle loading states and error conditions gracefully
Step 3: Frontend Components
Create CycleResultsBanner component using existing Card and Badge patterns
Build winner and non-winner variants within same component
Follow existing mobile-first patterns from Dashboard.tsx
Use established SectionHeader styling for consistency
Include loading and error states matching existing dashboard patterns
Step 4: Overview Tab Integration
Enhance existing Dashboard Overview tab to call /api/cycles/current/user-status
Use established useEffect and loadCycleAnalytics() patterns
Display loading state while fetching user status (crucial for smooth UX)
Display CycleResultsBanner at top of Overview when active notifications exist
Mark notification as displayed after showing
Handle error states and timeout scenarios gracefully
Step 5: Admin Integration
Connect existing "Seal Winners" button to enhanced seal endpoint
Add visual confirmation that user notifications have been triggered
Show batch update progress with participant counts and completion status
Handle timeout scenarios with appropriate admin feedback
Maintain existing admin workflow without disruption
Step 6: Comprehensive Testing & Screenshots
Run cycle selection → seal → verify banners appear for both winner/non-winner users
Test banner persistence across user sessions until next cycle
Verify banners clear correctly when new cycle begins (reset notification state)
Validate batch database operations complete successfully under various load conditions
Test timeout scenarios and error handling for large user bases
Test loading states and graceful error degradation
Capture mobile screenshots of both winner and non-winner experiences
Validate cross-session persistence and state management
This production-ready plan ensures scalability, robust error handling, and seamless integration with existing infrastructure.
