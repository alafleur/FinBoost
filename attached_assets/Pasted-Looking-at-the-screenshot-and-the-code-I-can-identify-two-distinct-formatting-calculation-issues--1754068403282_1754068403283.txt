Looking at the screenshot and the code, I can identify two distinct formatting/calculation issues:

Issues Identified
Winner Banner Payout Display Error: The banner shows "$1,000" instead of "$3.70" (the correct override amount)
Total Pool Display Error: Shows "$750,500" instead of "$7,500" - this appears to be a formatting issue where the value is being multiplied by 100 or displayed incorrectly
Root Cause Analysis
From examining the codebase:

Issue 1: Winner Banner Payout Amount
In WinnerCelebrationBanner.tsx, the payout amount is likely being pulled from the wrong field or not properly formatted. The banner should display the final payout amount (considering overrides), not a default calculated amount.

Issue 2: Total Pool Display
The pool amount formatting is incorrect - showing $750,500 instead of $7,500. This suggests:

Values stored in cents (750,500 cents = $7,505) but being displayed as dollars
Or a multiplication error in the display logic
Or incorrect data being fetched from the backend
Proposed Fix Plan
Step 1: Fix Winner Banner Payout Display
Check WinnerCelebrationBanner.tsx component
Ensure it's using payoutFinal or the correct override amount from the winner status API
Verify the /api/user/winner-status endpoint returns the correct payout amount
Step 2: Fix Total Pool Display
Check the pool calculation in the banner display logic
Verify the backend /api/cycles/pool endpoint returns values in the correct format
Ensure frontend formatting divides by 100 if values are stored in cents
Step 3: Data Integrity Check
Verify the database values for user608@test.com winner record
Confirm the payoutOverride field contains 370 (cents) for $3.70
Check the cycle's totalRewardPool field contains 7500 (cents) for $75.00
Step 4: Testing
Test the winner banner display with the corrected user
Verify total pool amounts display correctly across the dashboard
Confirm override amounts are properly reflected in all displays
The core issue appears to be inconsistent handling of cent-based values vs dollar-based values in the display components, particularly in the winner celebration banner and pool amount formatting.
