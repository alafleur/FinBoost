I’ve reviewed the latest version of `Home.tsx` on GitHub. To combine the **"How It Works"** and **"Rewards Breakdown"** sections into a single, cleaner flow, here's a recommendation that maintains clarity while improving layout and narrative momentum.

---

## 🎯 Goals:

* Reduce visual redundancy
* Make the user journey more cohesive (learn → take action → earn rewards)
* Keep competitive structure and payout clarity

---

## ✅ Recommended Combined Section Title:

**How It Works (and How You Win)**
or
**Earn While You Learn: How FinBoost Works**

---

## 🧱 Suggested Structure:

```tsx
<section className="bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-100 to-slate-200 py-16 px-4">
  <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-8">
    Earn While You Learn: How FinBoost Works
  </h2>

  <div className="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-8 text-center">

    {/* Step 1 */}
    <div>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Learn Fast</h3>
      <p>Complete short financial lessons and quizzes to earn points. Topics cover budgeting, debt, saving, investing, and more.</p>
    </div>

    {/* Step 2 */}
    <div>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Take Real Action</h3>
      <p>Submit proof of debt paydown to earn big bonus points. We reward real financial progress.</p>
    </div>

    {/* Step 3 */}
    <div>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Compete for Rewards</h3>
      <p>Your points determine your chances of winning. Top performers earn higher payouts — and more than half of members win something each cycle.</p>
    </div>

  </div>

  <div className="mt-12 text-center">
    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Reward Payouts by Tier</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">Each cycle, the pool is split across three tiers based on your point totals.</p>

    <ul className="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 text-left max-w-4xl mx-auto">
      <li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> Top performers — biggest share of the prize pool</li>
      <li><strong>Tier 2:</strong> Middle scorers — consistent, solid payouts</li>
      <li><strong>Tier 3:</strong> Lower scorers — still have a chance to win</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mt-6 text-sm text-gray-500 italic">
      Exact distributions may vary. Every cycle, at least half of engaged members win rewards.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>
```

## ✂️ Additional Tips:

* **Remove the standalone “Rewards Breakdown” component** (the content is integrated)
* Add the **Community Growth Dial** either above or below this section for visual energy
* Keep the **"Guaranteed Minimums for Top Rewards"** as its own block — it’s a strong value prop

Let me know if you want this turned into a React component or integrated into your existing layout.
