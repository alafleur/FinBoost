Based on the console logs and error messages we've been seeing, here's a comprehensive explanation for the Agent:

Problem Summary
The Expanded Leaderboard feature is failing to load data, showing "No users found" even though there are 72 premium members in the system. The issue appears to be in the getExpandedLeaderboard method in the backend.

What I Was Trying to Fix
The getExpandedLeaderboard method in server/storage.ts was experiencing a Drizzle ORM error where Object.entries() was being called on an undefined or null value. This was preventing the expanded leaderboard from fetching and displaying user data properly.

Changes I Made
Replaced Drizzle ORM queries with raw SQL in the getExpandedLeaderboard method to avoid table reference issues
Updated the module completion query to use raw SQL instead of Drizzle's table references
Improved error handling to prevent the entire function from failing
Fixed result mapping to properly handle the database response format
Current Issues Still Experienced
The expanded leaderboard still shows "No users found" despite having 72 premium members
Console shows successful API calls (GET /api/leaderboard/expanded) but the frontend receives empty data
The regular leaderboard works fine - it's specifically the expanded version that's failing
No obvious error messages in the current console logs, suggesting the query runs but returns empty results
Technical Details for the Agent
The issue is in the getExpandedLeaderboard method starting around line 820 in server/storage.ts
The method should return an array of users with fields: rank, username, points, tier, streak, modulesCompleted, joinDate
The frontend component ExpandedLeaderboard.tsx is properly configured and should display data if the backend returns it correctly
The query needs to fetch premium users (subscription_status = 'active') and join with user_progress table for module completion counts
Suggested Debugging Steps for the Agent
Check if the raw SQL queries are returning proper data structure
Verify the user_progress table has data and the join is working correctly
Ensure the response format matches what the frontend expects
Consider testing the queries directly in the database to isolate the issue
The core functionality works (regular leaderboard, user authentication, points system), but this specific expanded view is not populating with user data despite the underlying data being present in the system.
