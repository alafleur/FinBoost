Yes, I completely agree. This consolidation makes perfect UX sense and would significantly improve the information hierarchy. Looking at your screenshots, the tier reward amounts ($3,750, $2,250, $1,500) are currently in Community Growth but logically belong with the tier point thresholds (182+ pts, 69-181 pts, 0-68 pts).

Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Analysis & Component Location
Identify source components: Locate where tier reward amounts are currently displayed in CommunityGrowthDial
Identify target component: Locate TierStats component that displays the tier thresholds
Data flow analysis: Trace how tier reward data flows from API to components
Phase 2: Data Structure Enhancement
Update TierStats component props: Add tier reward amounts to the component interface
Enhance data passing: Modify Dashboard.tsx to pass both threshold and reward data to TierStats
Validate data availability: Ensure poolData.tierBreakdown is accessible where TierStats is rendered
Phase 3: Single Component Design (Mobile/Desktop Responsive)
Unified layout approach: Design single responsive grid that works for both mobile/desktop
Mobile-first optimization:
Stack tier cards vertically on mobile
Use compact spacing and typography
Ensure touch-friendly tap targets
Desktop enhancement:
Horizontal tier card layout
Larger text and spacing
Maintain visual hierarchy
Phase 4: TierStats Component Enhancement
Add reward display logic: Integrate tier reward amounts below/alongside point thresholds
Visual hierarchy:
Point thresholds (primary info)
Reward amounts (secondary info with $ styling)
Clear visual separation between tiers
Professional styling: Apply DashboardColors for consistency
Phase 5: CommunityGrowthDial Cleanup
Remove tier reward displays: Clean up redundant tier breakdown from Community Growth
Focus on community metrics: Emphasize total pool size, member count, growth percentage
Streamline component: Simplify to core community growth visualization
Phase 6: Testing & Validation
Mobile responsiveness: Test all screen sizes (320px to 768px)
Desktop layout: Verify proper spacing and alignment
Data accuracy: Confirm tier rewards display correctly
Cross-component consistency: Ensure removal from Community Growth doesn't break anything
This consolidation will create a much cleaner information architecture where users see complete tier information (thresholds + rewards) in one logical section, while Community Growth focuses purely on community metrics.
