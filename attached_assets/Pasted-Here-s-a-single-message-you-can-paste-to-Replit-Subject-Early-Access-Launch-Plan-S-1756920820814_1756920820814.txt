**Subject:** Early-Access Launch Plan — Signups → First Cycle Timing (Finalized Guidance)

Team — here’s the product direction for launch timing and early-access UX. **No code changes yet**; this is the shared plan and handles to prepare for.

### Definitions

* **Cycle length:** 7 days.
* **TCS (Time from Signup → Cycle Start):** How long a new user waits before their first 7-day cycle begins.
* **TFD (Time from Signup → First Draw):** `TCS + 7 days` (the draw occurs at the end of the user’s first cycle).

### Guardrails

* **TCS target:** **0–3 days** ideal; **≤7 days** acceptable.
* **TFD implication:** **7–10 days** ideal; **≤14 days** acceptable.
* If TCS for a meaningful share of new users would exceed 7 days, we’ll adjust scheduling (see below).

### Scheduling Approach (during ramp → steady state)

1. **Ramp phase (recommended):** Start a new cohort **every 3–4 days** to keep TCS ≤3–4 days for most signups.
2. **Steady state:** Transition to a **fixed weekly start** (e.g., **Mon 00:00 ET**) once volume is stable.
3. **Fallback (if growth lags):** Use a **hybrid trigger for Cycle 1 start** — “**on DATE or when we reach N members, whichever comes first**,” with a **guaranteed prize floor** for that cycle. (This hybrid is about **cycle start**, not the draw.)

### Access & Gating

* **Open access now:** Users can register, log in, complete lessons, and **bank Tickets** immediately.
* **Gate payouts/draws only:** Drawings and cash disbursements remain gated until the user’s cycle completes.
* **No hard waitlist.** If needed, use a soft “Early Access Preview” (dashboard visible, lessons enabled, Tickets accrue).

### Messaging (use “Tickets,” not “points”)

* Global copy:

  * “**Tickets bank now. Your first cycle starts on *DATE*. Your first drawing occurs 7 days after your cycle starts.**”
  * If we use a hybrid start: “**Cycle 1 begins on *DATE* or at *N* members (whichever comes first)** — **prize floor: *\$X***.”
* Rewards/Dashboard hero should show **countdown to cycle start** (for that user), **member progress** (if hybrid), and **pool floor**.
* Compliance: “**No purchase necessary. 18+. Odds vary by number of Tickets earned. AMOE applies.**”

### Minimal product handles to plan for (flags/state; no implementation requested yet)

* `earlyAccess: boolean`
* `cycleStartSchedule: 'every_3d' | 'weekly_mon' | 'hybrid'`
* `firstCycleStartDate: ISO` *(if hybrid)*
* `memberGoalForStart: number` *(if hybrid)*
* `guaranteedPrizeFloor: number`
* `ticketsBankingEnabled: true`
* `referralsEnabled: true`

### Metrics to monitor at launch

* **TCS distribution** (median & 80th percentile).
* **Time-to-first-Ticket** (<5 min target).
* Lesson completion (D0/D7), referral send→convert, DAU/WAU, and % of users who view/acknowledge cycle start info.

### Decisions we will confirm shortly

* The initial **DATE**, **N** (if hybrid), and ***\$ floor***.
* Exact copy blocks for the Rewards hero and Dashboard top card.

That’s the plan—please align any upcoming work and comms to this framing.
