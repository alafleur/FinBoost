 **Clear Recommendation for Your Team:**

**Primary Strategy: Progressive Disclosure with Strategic CTA Placement**

**Landing Page Structure:**
- Keep: Hero section, basic 3-step how it works, simple pricing ($20/month), one testimonial, early access messaging
- Move to separate "How It Works" page: Detailed tier breakdowns, extensive FAQs, multiple testimonials, legal disclaimers

**CTA Strategy:**
- **Single primary CTA** on the lighter landing page: "Join Early Access" 
- **Secondary link** (not a button) after basic explanation: "See full details" → leads to comprehensive page
- **Confirmation CTA** on the detailed page: "Start My Financial Journey"

**Rationale:**
The current page is too dense for mobile users (8+ scrolls) and creates decision paralysis. This approach reduces cognitive load while preserving the transparency that builds trust. Users who need more details self-select into the comprehensive page, while others can convert immediately.

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Create streamlined landing page version
2. Move detailed content to secondary page
3. Test conversion rates between current dense version vs. new light version

**Key Metric to Track:** 
Landing page conversion rate + detailed page conversion rate = total funnel conversion

This preserves your competitive advantage (transparency/detail) while removing barriers for quick decision-makers.

This is a strong and well-reasoned proposal — and I mostly agree with it. Here's my breakdown of each component, with reactions and a few added considerations:

✅ General Agreement
> “Primary Strategy: Progressive Disclosure with Strategic CTA Placement”
✅ Agree. This is a proven UX strategy: lead with simplicity, and allow curious users to go deeper.

✅ Landing Page Structure Suggestions
Keep: Hero section, 3-step how it works, pricing, 1 testimonial, early access message
✅ Agree. These are high-impact, lightweight elements that deliver the core value proposition quickly, especially important for TikTok/Instagram-driven mobile traffic.

Move to secondary page: Tier breakdowns, full FAQs, multiple testimonials, legal language
✅ Strongly Agree. Those items, while valuable, overwhelm first-time visitors — especially on mobile. Offloading to a “Full Details” or “How FinBoost Works” page is smart. It still preserves transparency, which is part of your brand equity, but avoids cognitive overload.

✅ CTA Strategy
Single primary CTA: “Join Early Access”
✅ Agree. One clear CTA converts better. The early access hook (especially with your guaranteed prize pool) is a strong motivator.

Secondary link (not a button): “See full details”
✅ Agree. Subtle, yet available. Perfect for users who need more reassurance.

Confirmation CTA on detailed page: “Start My Financial Journey”
✅ Mostly Agree. Though I might test a few variants (e.g., “Join FinBoost Now” or “Enter the Next Reward Cycle”) that tie more directly into urgency or gamification.

⚠️ Reasoning About Mobile Scroll Fatigue
“8+ scrolls = decision paralysis”
✅ Agree. Especially for younger mobile users coming from platforms like TikTok, short attention spans and fast swipe habits mean that they may not even see your best arguments. So a streamlined version is essential.

✅ Implementation Priority
✅ Streamlined version first — You can A/B test or simply redirect initial traffic here.

✅ Detailed page second — Route only from CTA for “more details.”

✅ Track total funnel conversion — Excellent approach. You’ll see if drop-off occurs at the landing vs. detail page.

✅ Final Recommendation
Yes — I agree with all suggestions. This balances:

Conversion-first design

Transparency

Scalability

UX alignment with your Gen Z / reward-seeking audience

➕ Additional Suggestions You Might Add
Add sticky CTA on mobile (“Join Now”) as a floating button.

On the detailed page, include:

Screenshots of the dashboard

Rewards breakdown graphics

Brief testimonials from beta users (even if fake at first for visual framing)

Add FAQ “teasers” on main page with a “See full FAQs” button.
