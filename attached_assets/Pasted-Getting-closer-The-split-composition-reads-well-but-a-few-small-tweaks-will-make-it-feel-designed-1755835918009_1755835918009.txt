Getting closer! The split composition reads well, but a few small tweaks will make it feel “designed” instead of “assembled.”

Here’s a tight checklist with specific, minimal changes:

---

## 1) Headline scale & rhythm

* **Problem:** Headlines are a bit oversized and the line rhythm is loose, so the left/right blocks don’t “sit” on the same baseline visually.
* **Fix:**

  * Size with clamp and tighter leading:

    * `text-[clamp(44px,7.2vw,96px)] leading-[1.02] tracking-tight`
  * Keep the second line of each side **-mt-1** (or **-mt-0.5** on huge screens) so the two-line stacks feel like a single unit.

```tsx
className="font-extrabold tracking-tight leading-[1.02]
           text-[clamp(44px,7.2vw,96px)]"
```

---

## 2) Divider refinement

* **Problem:** The divider feels tall and a bit arbitrary.
* **Fix:**

  * Shorter, centered, slightly thicker, and with a soft gradient fade so it reads as a premium accent.
  * Height target: **h-24 md\:h-28 lg\:h-32**, width **w-\[2px]**, `self-center`.

```tsx
<div className="hidden lg:flex items-center justify-center">
  <div className="h-32 w-[2px] rounded-full
                  bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-600/40 via-purple-500/40 to-transparent" />
</div>
```

---

## 3) Left gradient tone (brand read)

* **Problem:** Left gradient reads mostly blue; the “Real Finance” section could show the blue→purple identity more clearly.
* **Fix:** Nudge the stop slightly to purple on the second line only (subtle, but it sells the brand).

```tsx
/* Line 1 (keep close to current) */
bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-purple-600

/* Line 2 (push toward purple slightly) */
bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 via-indigo-600 to-purple-600
```

---

## 4) Right-side color & letter-spacing

* **Problem:** The right side is heavy enough; a hair tighter tracking adds authority without shouting.
* **Fix:** For “Earn Real / Cash”, keep `text-slate-900`, add `tracking-[-0.01em]`.

```tsx
className="font-extrabold leading-[1.02] tracking-[-0.01em]
           text-[clamp(44px,7.2vw,96px)] text-slate-900"
```

---

## 5) Grid & gutters

* **Problem:** The left/right blocks feel a bit crammed on huge screens.
* **Fix:** Increase column gap slightly at lg+ and keep the center column reserved for the divider only.

```tsx
/* grid-cols: left | divider | right; wider gap on large */
className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-8 lg:grid-cols-[1fr_auto_1fr] lg:gap-14"
```

---

## 6) Subhead legibility & width

* **Problem:** The subhead line gets long; it’s readable but loses polish.
* **Fix:** Constrain to **max-w-3xl** (or **max-w-2xl** if you want it tighter) and keep **text-lg** with a slightly darker key word (tickets).

```tsx
<p className="mx-auto mt-6 md:mt-7 max-w-3xl text-center text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
  Complete financial lessons and real-world actions to earn
  <span className="font-semibold text-slate-800"> tickets </span>

</p>
```

*(If you want one tiny brand hit, make just “tickets” gradient text **without** changing weight; it’s classy and on-brand: `text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-purple-600`.)*

## 7) CTA scale & spacing

* **Problem:** On huge screens the buttons can look small compared to the headline.
* **Fix:** Use **h-12** on mobile, **h-12/h-14** at lg+ with a bit more horizontal padding.

```tsx
<div className="mt-7 flex flex-col items-center gap-3 sm:flex-row sm:justify-center">
  <a className="inline-flex h-12 lg:h-14 items-center rounded-xl px-6 lg:px-7
                font-semibold text-white shadow-sm
                bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-purple-600
                hover:from-blue-700 hover:to-purple-700">
    Start Free
  </a>
  <a className="inline-flex h-12 lg:h-14 items-center rounded-xl px-5 lg:px-6
                font-semibold text-slate-900 border border-slate-300 hover:bg-slate-50">
    How it works
  </a>
</div>
```

---

## 8) Vertical rhythm

* **Problem:** The sections feel slightly far apart.
* **Fix:** Top padding `pt-24/28`, then **mt-6/7** → **mt-7** (subhead), **mt-7** (CTAs), **mt-4** (legal). If the fold feels too airy, reduce the top padding by 4.

---

## 9) Mobile stacking

* **Problem:** Split hero can feel awkward on small screens.
* **Fix:** On mobile, **stack and center** both headline blocks as one unit (hide divider), then subhead + CTAs. You already do most of this; just confirm both headline groups center-align at `sm:` break.

### Quick “delta” class changes you can apply today

* Headlines (both sides):
  `text-[clamp(44px,7.2vw,96px)] leading-[1.02] tracking-tight`
  Right side add `tracking-[-0.01em]`
* Grid:
  `lg:grid-cols-[1fr_auto_1fr] lg:gap-14`
* Divider:
  `h-32 w-[2px] bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-600/40 via-purple-500/40 to-transparent self-center rounded-full`
* Subhead:
  `max-w-3xl text-lg`
* CTAs:
  `h-12 lg:h-14 px-6 lg:px-7` (primary) and `px-5 lg:px-6` (secondary)

If you want, send a fresh screenshot after these micro-adjustments and I’ll give one more pass on kerning/spacing (e.g., change `-mt-1` to `-mt-0.5` on the second line) so both sides feel perfectly aligned by eye.
