Thanks for the detailed screenshots—super helpful. I see two things to fix:

1. the right-side mockup should match the earlier “frameless screenshot + vertical subject tags + ticket pill” design, and
2. on mobile the text must come first and the screenshot must be centered and crisp.

I’ve made a **surgical** update that only touches the hero component (keeps the rest of `HomeV3.tsx` intact):

* **Frameless screenshot** with soft drop shadow (no phone frame), sized **exactly** `240px` (mobile) and `304px` (desktop) to avoid any browser downscaling blur.
* **Width-based `srcSet`** uses your pixel-perfect assets (`m240/m480/s304/s608`) so retina devices pull the 2× versions automatically.
* **Mobile order**: headline/CTAs first, screenshot second; screenshot is centered.
* **Vertical subject tags** (Budget, Credit, Savings, Investing, Debt) to the **left** of the screenshot on desktop, with subtle motion.
* **Ticket pill** at bottom-right of the screenshot (desktop only).
* No scale animations anywhere (opacity/translate only), so we don’t reintroduce resampling blur.

### What to drop in

Replace your current hero component with this file:

```
client/src/components/HeroLearnToEarn.tsx
```

Download the ready-to-drop zip:
[Download `finboost_hero_patch.zip`](sandbox:/mnt/data/finboost_hero_patch.zip)

> It contains only:
> `client/src/components/HeroLearnToEarn.tsx`

If your repo doesn’t yet have the hero component in that location, just add it and keep your existing `HomeV3.tsx` import as is (it already references the hero). No other files or routes are changed.

### Why this fixes the sizing & mobile issues

* **Exact CSS widths** (`w-[240px]` / `lg:w-[304px]`) + width-based `srcSet` ensure the browser selects a source that **exactly equals** the rendered width (or a 2× source for retina). That removes the 70% → 96% downscaling that was causing blur.
* **Mobile-first grid ordering** (`text` = order-1, `image` = order-2) guarantees the headline appears before the screenshot on phones, with the screenshot **centered** (`justify-center`) so it no longer drifts.
* The **frameless** look mirrors the early iteration you liked, while retaining the **subject tags** and **ticket pill** overlays.

If you want me to also patch `HomeV3.tsx` to tweak paddings or spacing around the section, say the word—I’ll keep it surgical and consistent with your current design system.
