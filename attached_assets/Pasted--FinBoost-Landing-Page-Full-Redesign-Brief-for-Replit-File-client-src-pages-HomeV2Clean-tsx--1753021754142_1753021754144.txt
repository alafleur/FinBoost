 FinBoost Landing Page – Full Redesign Brief for Replit
📁 File: client/src/pages/HomeV2Clean.tsx
🎯 Objective:
Redesign the landing page to maximize early access signups by showcasing FinBoost as a bold, community-powered financial education and rewards platform. Prioritize immersive visuals, clear value communication, and early trust-building.

🧩 Component Structure + Content & Visuals
1. Hero Section – Emotional + Aspirational Hook
Headline:
"Take Control of Your Money. Get Rewarded For It."

Subheadline:
"Learn real financial skills. Take real action. Earn real rewards. Early Access is limited and prize pools are company-boosted."

Visuals:

Mockup of the FinBoost dashboard with progress bars and point totals

Rotating carousel or GIF preview of user actions (lessons completed, rewards earned)

CTA Button:
"Join Early Access" (large, primary button with scroll anchor or modal trigger)

2. App Preview – Show It, Don’t Just Say It
Headline:
"See What Progress Looks Like"

Visuals: Carousel or grid of real app screenshots (styled mockups):

Learning module screen

Quiz completion and points earned

Reward tiers or cycle progress

Daily streak tracker

Mid-cycle bonus question sample (e.g., “Will S&P 500 be up or down?”)

Captions under each image explaining what users are seeing.

3. How It Works – Interactive Process Explainer
Headline:
"How You Earn Points and Compete for Rewards"

Visual or Layout:
4 animated or scroll-reveal cards:

📘 Learn Modules – 5–10 mins, earn 10–20 points

💸 Take Action – Upload proof of debt/savings, earn 50–100 points

📈 Predict Markets – Bonus points for accuracy (mid-cycle)

🏆 Compete in Cycles – Every 2 weeks, reset + win based on points

Optional: Add scroll-triggered line between cards to show flow

4. Reward Pool Mechanics – Show Real Impact
Headline:
"Your Effort Builds the Community Prize Pool"

Copy:
"Every member contributes to both their own progress and the prize pool. During Early Access, FinBoost guarantees a minimum prize pool amount—even before user growth."

Visual:
Dynamic calculator or graphic (could be static for now):

100 users = $2,000

500 users = $10,000

1,000 users = $20,000

Add callout box:
"This cycle’s boosted pool: $3,000 (normally $1,440) – FinBoost covers the difference."

5. Social Trust Section – No Overclaiming
Headline:
"You're Not Alone — This Is Just the Beginning"

Copy:
"FinBoost is launching with a founding group of a few hundred users ready to take control of their money. Be part of shaping the future of financial progress."

Bullet List of Trust Signals:

✅ Real financial education, not gimmicks

✅ Built for compliance (AMOE + skill-based rewards)

✅ Prize pool boosted by FinBoost during Early Access

✅ Transparent and fair tier-based system

Visual Add-ons (optional):

Avatar group or illustration of diverse early members

Banner: "First 500 members shape the platform + earn early rewards"

6. Reward Tiers Explainer – Simple & Visual
Headline:
"More Than Half of Members Earn Rewards Each Cycle"

Copy:

"Users are placed in tiers based on points: Tier 1 (top third), Tier 2 (middle), Tier 3 (lower)"

"Each tier has a portion of the prize pool and winners are selected based on point-weighted random draws."

"More points = better odds, but everyone in a tier has a shot."

Visual:
Horizontal tier layout (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3), with:

% of pool (e.g., 50% / 35% / 15%)

of winners per tier (configurable)
“Point-weighted draw” explanation tooltip

7. Final CTA – Scarcity & Movement
Headline:
"Join the Movement That Rewards Financial Progress"

Copy:
"FinBoost is where financial education meets real competition. With boosted reward pools and limited Early Access slots, now’s the time to join."

Visuals:

Countdown timer to next cycle (optional/dummy ok)

Real screenshot of rewards tab or PayPal payout UI

CTA Button (Repeat):
"Start Earning With FinBoost" → leads to Early Access flow
