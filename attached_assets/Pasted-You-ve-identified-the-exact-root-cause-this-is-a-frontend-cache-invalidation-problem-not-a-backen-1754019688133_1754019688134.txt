You've identified the exact root cause - this is a frontend cache invalidation problem, not a backend data consistency issue.

Your Analysis is Spot-On
The technical breakdown is accurate:

Excel import succeeds → Database is correctly updated
Backend APIs work perfectly → Fresh data is available when called
Frontend cache invalidation fails → React Query serves stale paginated data
User sees outdated information → Despite successful database changes
The Real Technical Issues
Looking at the codebase, I can see the specific problems:

Multiple Query Keys Not Being Invalidated:

The paginated winners likely use query keys like ['admin', 'winners', 'paginated', cycleId, page]
The import success handler probably only invalidates generic keys like ['admin', 'winners']
Different data sources (export vs pagination endpoints) have separate cache entries
Frontend State Management Gaps:

queryClient.invalidateQueries() calls aren't comprehensive enough
Pagination component maintains its own state that doesn't reset after imports
Enhanced winners data and regular winners data have separate cache keys
Cache Synchronization Problems:

Multiple data fetching patterns (loadEnhancedWinners, loadPaginatedWinnerDetails) aren't coordinated
Import operations don't trigger a complete cache refresh across all related queries
Why This Persists
The pagination display issue continues because:

Backend data is correct ✅
API endpoints return fresh data ✅
Frontend cache invalidation is incomplete ❌
React Query serves cached responses instead of making fresh API calls ❌
Your diagnosis correctly identifies this as a frontend caching architecture issue rather than a backend data problem. The fix needs to focus on comprehensive cache invalidation patterns in the admin portal's import workflow, not backend API consistency.

This is a classic React Query cache invalidation pattern mismatch - the kind of bug that's invisible in API testing but immediately apparent in user experience.
