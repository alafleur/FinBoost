Looking at your issue, I can see the problem clearly. The Enhanced Selected Winners table is not appearing despite successful winner selection execution. Let me analyze the potential causes:

Root Cause Analysis
Based on the code in CycleOperationsTab.tsx and the logs showing successful winner selection (750 winners), the issue is likely one of these:

1. State Management Issue
The paginatedWinners state may not be getting updated after winner selection. The table visibility depends on paginatedWinners.winners.length > 0, but if loadPaginatedWinnerDetails() isn't being called or failing silently, the table won't render.

2. API Response Structure Mismatch
The loadPaginatedWinnerDetails() function expects a specific response structure from /api/admin/cycle-winner-details/${cycleId}/paginated, but there might be a mismatch between what the backend returns and what the frontend expects.

3. Cycle State Not Updated
The winner selection execution might not be updating the cycle's selectionExecuted flag properly, which could affect the UI rendering logic.

4. Race Condition
The handleExecuteWinnerSelection() function calls loadPaginatedWinnerDetails() after selection, but there might be a timing issue where the call happens before the database transaction is fully committed.

Key Areas to Check
In CycleOperationsTab.tsx around lines 346-425: Verify that after successful winner selection, the loadPaginatedWinnerDetails() is being called with the correct cycle ID.

State initialization: Check if paginatedWinners state is being properly initialized and updated.

Backend API: Verify that /api/admin/cycle-winner-details/${cycleId}/paginated is returning data in the expected format.

Database persistence: Confirm that the 750 winners are actually saved to the cycle_winner_selections table.

Most Likely Fix Needed
The issue is probably in the handleExecuteWinnerSelection() success callback where it should be calling loadPaginatedWinnerDetails() but either:

The call is missing
The call is happening too early (before DB commit)
The API endpoint is returning empty results
The state update isn't triggering a re-render
The Enhanced View table rendering is conditional on paginatedWinners.winners.length > 0, so if this array is empty, the entire section won't appear, which matches your symptoms exactly.
