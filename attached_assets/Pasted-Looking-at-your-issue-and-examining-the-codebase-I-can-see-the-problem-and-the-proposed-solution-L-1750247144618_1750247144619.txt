Looking at your issue and examining the codebase, I can see the problem and the proposed solution. Let me assess this:

Analysis of the Issue
The issue description makes sense from a technical standpoint. Looking at the Dashboard.tsx code, I can see that:

Mobile Layout: The Overview tab is within a complex Tabs component with multiple nested layers and event handlers

Click Handler Complexity: The learning modules in the Overview tab are rendered inside:

Outer Tabs component with onValueChange handlers
Card components with hover effects and transitions
Multiple nested div elements with potential event listeners
Complex state management for tab switching
Event Bubbling Issues: The current code in the Overview tab (around line 586) shows:

onClick={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.stopPropagation();
  console.log(`Overview tab - navigating to lesson ${module.id}`);
  setLocation(`/lesson/${module.id}`);
}}
Root Cause Assessment
You're correct that this is likely an event conflict issue. Here's why:

Tab Context Interference: The Overview tab has active tab state management that could interfere with navigation
Event Bubbling: Without stopPropagation(), click events bubble up and might trigger tab change logic instead of navigation
Component Rendering Context: The Overview tab renders modules as a preview (showing only 3-6 modules), while the Learn tab renders the full module list
Verification of the Fix
Looking at the code, I can see the fix has been partially applied in some places but may not be consistent throughout. The solution approach is sound:

e.preventDefault() prevents any default anchor/button behavior
e.stopPropagation() prevents event bubbling to parent tab handlers
Explicit logging helps debug navigation attempts
Additional Considerations
However, I notice a few things that could still cause issues:

Inconsistent Route Patterns: Some places use /lesson/${module.id} while others might use /education/${module.id}
Component State: The complex Dashboard state management might need to be considered
Tab Focus: After navigation, the user returns to the same tab state
My Assessment
The diagnosis and fix approach are technically sound. The event handling solution should resolve the 404 issues. The root cause analysis correctly identifies that this is a client-side routing conflict rather than a server-side issue.

The fix is minimally invasive and follows React best practices for event handling in complex component hierarchies.
