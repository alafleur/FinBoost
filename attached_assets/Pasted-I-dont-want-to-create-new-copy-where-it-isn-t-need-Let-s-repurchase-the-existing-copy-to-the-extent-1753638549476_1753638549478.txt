I dont want to create new copy where it isn't need. Let's repurchase the existing copy to the extent you think it's relevant


ChatGPT said:
Perfect — here’s a remapped version that reuses your existing V3 landing page copy wherever it aligns well with the new two-page structure. I’ve broken this down into:

✅ Use as-is

✍️ Edit slightly for tone or flow

❌ Move to secondary page

💡 New or missing (minimal)

🔷 PAGE 1: Streamlined Main Landing Page
✅ Hero Section
Use as-is with very minor tweaks
Current:

“Crushed by debt? Can’t build savings? You’re not alone — but now, you’re not on your own.”
Learn real money skills, take real action, and earn real rewards. Backed by a guaranteed prize pool.

✅ Keep the company guarantee line — very compelling for early access

✅ How It Works (3-Step Preview)
Use short version of your existing “How It Works” section.

✍️ Adapt from your 5-step version to a concise 3-step preview:

Learn & earn points from short lessons and quizzes

Take real financial actions like paying down debt

Compete for rewards — the more points, the bigger your chances

Add small text:

Want the full breakdown? [See How It Works →]

✅ Why People Join (Membership Value)
Use this from your current section “How Your Membership Fuels the Movement.”
✅ Use this paragraph almost exactly:

Your $20/month membership funds your financial growth and helps grow our collective prize pool. The more members, the more opportunity — for everyone.

💡 Add graphic dial reused from your existing CommunityGrowthDial component (already in V3).

✅ Early Access Guarantee
Repurpose your “Guaranteed Minimums” section:
✍️ Trim slightly for visual density:

Headline:

“Join Early. We Guarantee the First $5,000 Prize Pool.”

Body:

During early access, FinBoost guarantees a $5,000 prize pool per cycle — even if we don’t hit 500 users.
We’re also guaranteeing minimum rewards for the top 5 winners. This offer won’t last.

✅ Include CTA: [Join Early Access Now]

✅ Light Social Proof
Use one line from your "Real People Win Real Rewards" section:

“More than half of active members win something each cycle.”

✍️ Pair this with a testimonial from the existing section.

✅ Pricing Section
Use as-is from your “What It Costs” section.

$20/month
No long-term commitment. Cancel anytime.
No purchase necessary — alternate entry available.

✅ Keep the point that “most members win back more than they pay.”

✅ Final CTA
Use your existing FinalCTA.tsx copy (with button):

Ready to turn your financial stress into collective strength?

🔷 PAGE 2: “How It Works” Detail Page
✅ Why FinBoost Exists
✅ Use existing section from V3.

✍️ Cut redundant lines (as previously discussed) to streamline:

FinBoost exists because traditional financial advice isn't working. We’re not just teaching people — we’re giving them a reason to act. That means lessons tied to real-world rewards, powered by the strength of a collective movement.

✅ Learning & Points
Use from your “What You Learn” and quiz explanation section.

✍️ Add clarity on:

Lesson frequency (released weekly and mid-cycle)

Daily market lessons with quizzes

Real action submissions (e.g., uploading proof of debt payments)

✅ Tier System (Simplified)
Keep conceptual explanation, but remove fixed % splits like 50/35/15 (per your preference).

✍️ Say:

Users are grouped into performance tiers each cycle based on total points. More points = higher tier = larger rewards. The system adapts automatically based on participation.

✅ Reward Payout Logic
Use the structure from your "How Real People Win Real Rewards" section.

✍️ Include:

Rewards distributed based on points, not luck

More than 50% of engaged users win

Admin can adjust rewards before final payout (don’t need to show this but reinforces human oversight)

✅ Show reward examples (top 5, middle tier, lower tier)

✅ FAQs + Legal
Move from current FAQ.tsx component

✍️ Optionally trim or hide until needed. Could be an accordion layout with:

Is this gambling?

How are winners selected?

Can I participate without paying?

How often are new lessons released?
