## ‚úÖ FULL `HomeV3.tsx` DESIGN/UI IMPROVEMENT BUNDLE

### üîπ 1. GLOBAL SECTION SPACING STANDARDIZATION

**Update all major sections to use consistent vertical padding:**

```tsx
<section className="w-full bg-white py-16 px-6"> 
```

Or alternate with:

```tsx
<section className="w-full bg-gray-50 py-16 px-6"> 
```

Use `py-16` for clean vertical breathing room. Use `bg-gray-50` every 2nd or 3rd section for rhythm.
