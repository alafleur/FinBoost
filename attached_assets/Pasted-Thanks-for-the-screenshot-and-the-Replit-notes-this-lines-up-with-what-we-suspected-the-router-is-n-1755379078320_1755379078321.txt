Thanks for the screenshot and the Replit notes—this lines up with what we suspected: the router is now being hit, but the **by-cycle query** is returning an empty array. That usually happens when the ORM is filtering a **numeric column with a string** (e.g., `"18"` vs `18`) or when the query is hitting a slightly different table/column name than expected.

I put together a **drop-in backend patch** that (a) **forces `cycleId` to a number** (the most likely fix), and (b) adds a **Postgres fallback** with light schema introspection so it still works if Prisma model names differ from table names.

### ✅ Download the code

[Download the patch (zip)](sandbox:/mnt/data/finboost-disbursements-overhaul.zip)

Inside the zip:

* `server/routes/adminPayoutBatchesRouter.js` — new route with the numeric filter fix and PG fallback
* `server/utils/pg.js` — tiny `pg` pool helper (uses `DATABASE_URL`)
* `server/README-DisbursementsOverhaul.md` — quick setup/verify steps

---

## What this fixes (in plain English)

* `GET /api/admin/payout-batches?cycleId=18`
  Now **parses `cycleId` to an integer** before querying (Prisma and many ORMs won’t match when a string is passed for a numeric column—result is `[]`, which is exactly what you’re seeing).
* If Prisma models don’t match your actual table names (or are missing), the route **falls back to PostgreSQL**, auto-detecting likely table/column names (`payout_batches` / `payout_items`, etc.) and returns viable rows with `item_count` (and `total_amount` when an amount column is present).

---

## Quick install & wire-up (copy/paste)

1. Add the files from the zip into your repo preserving paths:

```
server/routes/adminPayoutBatchesRouter.js
server/utils/pg.js
server/README-DisbursementsOverhaul.md
```

2. Ensure `pg` is installed:

```bash
npm i pg
# or
yarn add pg
```

3. Confirm `DATABASE_URL` is set in Replit Secrets. If your DB enforces SSL:

* set `PGSSLMODE=require` (the helper tolerates self-signed).

4. Register the router (in your Express bootstrap, e.g., `server/index.js`):

```js
const { adminPayoutBatchesRouter } = require('./routes/adminPayoutBatchesRouter');
app.use('/api/admin/payout-batches', adminPayoutBatchesRouter);
```

Remove/disable any old payout-batches route to avoid conflicts.

## How to verify

* Start the server and open the admin Disbursements tab (or hit via curl/Postman):

  * `GET /api/admin/payout-batches?cycleId=18`
  * `GET /api/admin/payout-batches/active`
* Expect the first call to **return rows** (not `[]`) if batches exist for cycle 18.
* Your UI “Loading…” card should switch to showing the batch list.

---

## Why I’m confident this addresses the remaining issue

* Your logs show `/active` returns data while `/` with `cycleId=18` returns `[]`. That difference is classic **type-mismatch** behavior in ORMs.
* The patch **forces numeric filtering** and, if Prisma model naming doesn’t match your tables, **falls back to SQL** with conservative column detection so it still returns your rows.

If you want me to also ship a **front-end “Batches” card** that renders the returned structure (with counts/totals and an error/empty state), say the word and I’ll include a ready-to-drop React component too.
