Looking at the codebase and the recurring issues with the Overview tab lesson navigation, here's my comprehensive step-by-step plan to replace the learning modules with a clean CTA button:

Phase 1: Analysis & Planning (Pre-Implementation)
Identify Impact Areas

Overview tab learning section (both mobile and desktop layouts)
Module validation logic that's currently causing issues
Progress tracking display
Completed lessons count display
Design the CTA Solution

Replace the complex module grid with a single, prominent CTA card
Maintain the progress summary (completed lessons count)
Keep the "Continue Learning" section header for consistency
Ensure the CTA is visually appealing and matches the existing design system
Phase 2: Implementation Strategy
Step 1: Create the CTA Component

Design a new card component that matches the existing Overview tab aesthetic
Include progress information (X of Y lessons completed)
Add an engaging call-to-action message
Use existing design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
Step 2: Update Mobile Layout

Replace the availableLessons.map() section with the new CTA card
Maintain the same spacing and visual hierarchy
Keep the section header and progress badge
Ensure the CTA button directs to /education or the Learn tab
Step 3: Update Desktop Layout

Replace the desktop grid layout with the same CTA card
Maintain responsive design principles
Keep consistent styling between mobile and desktop
Step 4: Remove Unused Logic

Remove module validation functions that are causing issues
Clean up the complex module filtering logic
Keep only the progress counting logic (still needed for the CTA)
Remove debugging console.log statements related to module validation
Phase 3: Testing & Validation
Functionality Testing

Verify the CTA button properly navigates to /education
Test the Learn tab navigation alternative
Ensure progress counting still works correctly
Test both mobile and desktop responsiveness
Visual Testing

Confirm the Overview tab still looks polished and complete
Verify spacing and alignment match the existing design
Test the visual hierarchy flows naturally
Ensure the CTA feels integrated, not like something is missing
Integration Testing

Verify other Overview tab sections remain unaffected
Test navigation between tabs works correctly
Confirm the Learn tab functionality remains intact
Test the actual lesson navigation from the Learn tab
Phase 4: Code Quality & Cleanup
Remove Dead Code

Remove validateModule function
Remove validPublishedModules filtering
Remove complex module validation logging
Keep only essential progress tracking
Optimize Performance

Reduce API calls if any are no longer needed
Simplify the Overview tab rendering logic
Maintain existing loading states and error handling
Phase 5: Final Validation
User Experience Testing
Ensure the Overview tab feels complete and purposeful
Verify the CTA provides clear next steps for users
Test the flow from Overview → Learn tab → individual lessons
Confirm no functionality is lost, just relocated
This approach ensures:

No breaking changes to existing functionality
Maintains visual appeal of the Overview tab
Eliminates the navigation bug entirely
Preserves all lesson functionality in the Learn tab
Keeps the component unified (no separate mobile/desktop components)
Improves maintainability by removing complex validation logic
The end result will be a cleaner, more reliable Overview tab that guides users to the proper learning section without the technical complexity that's been causing issues.
