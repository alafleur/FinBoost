# Integrated Pool Settings → Winner Selection → PayPal Disbursements Demo

## BEFORE: Three Separate Systems
- **Pool Settings**: Configure reward percentages and fees in isolation
- **Winner Selection**: Manual input of pool amounts and percentages  
- **PayPal Disbursements**: Separate recipient lists and manual amount entry

## AFTER: Unified Workflow

### Step 1: Pool Settings Drive Everything
**Pool Configuration:**
- Membership Fee: $20.00/month
- Reward Pool Percentage: 25%
- Active Subscribers: 72 users

**Automatic Calculation:**
- Monthly Revenue: 72 × $20 = $1,440
- Total Reward Pool: $1,440 × 25% = $360
- Tier 1 Pool (50%): $180
- Tier 2 Pool (35%): $126  
- Tier 3 Pool (15%): $54

### Step 2: Winner Selection Uses Pool Settings
**Percentile-Based Tiers (No Manual Thresholds):**
- Tier 1: Top 33% performers (24 users)
- Tier 2: Middle 33% performers (24 users)  
- Tier 3: Bottom 33% performers (24 users)

**Random Selection (~50% per tier):**
- Tier 1: 12 winners @ $15.00 each ($180 ÷ 12)
- Tier 2: 12 winners @ $10.50 each ($126 ÷ 12)
- Tier 3: 12 winners @ $4.50 each ($54 ÷ 12)

### Step 3: PayPal Disbursements Use Selection Results
**Automatic Processing:**
- Recipients: Pulled directly from winner selection
- Amounts: Calculated amounts from pool allocation
- Total Disbursement: $360 (matches pool settings)
- PayPal Batch: Single API call for all winners

## Key Integration Points

1. **No Redundant Inputs**: Pool settings automatically flow to selection calculations
2. **Real-Time Calculations**: Revenue → Pool → Individual amounts calculated live
3. **Validation Chain**: Each step validates the previous step's data
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete traceability from settings to final payments

## Admin Interface Flow

1. **Configure Pool Settings** → Sets revenue percentage and membership fees
2. **Create Winner Cycle** → Uses current pool settings automatically  
3. **Run Selection** → Displays calculated pool breakdown and individual amounts
4. **Process Disbursements** → One-click PayPal processing of exact amounts

The three previously separate systems now operate as a single integrated workflow with no manual data entry between steps.
