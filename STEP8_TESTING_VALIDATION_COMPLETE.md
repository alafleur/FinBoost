## Defensive Constants Validated

All 13 defensive constants implemented in Step 7 are thoroughly tested:

```typescript
// Input Validation Constants
MIN_AMOUNT_CENTS = 100         // $1.00 minimum
MAX_AMOUNT_CENTS = 10000000    // $100,000 maximum  
MIN_CYCLE_ID = 1               // Minimum cycle ID
MAX_ADMIN_ID = 999999          // Maximum admin ID
MAX_RECIPIENTS_PER_BATCH = 1000 // PayPal API limit

// Circuit Breaker Constants  
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD = 5    // Failures to open circuit
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TIMEOUT_MS = 300000      // 5-minute recovery timeout
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_SUCCESS_THRESHOLD = 3    // Successes to close circuit

// Resource Protection Constants
MAX_CONCURRENT_OPERATIONS = 10           // Maximum concurrent operations

// Timeout Constants
TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT_MS = 1800000         // 30-minute overall timeout
PHASE_1_TIMEOUT_MS = 300000             // 5-minute Phase 1 timeout
PHASE_2_TIMEOUT_MS = 600000             // 10-minute Phase 2 timeout
ROLLBACK_TIMEOUT_MS = 180000            // 3-minute rollback timeout
```

- ✅ Layer interaction and priority handling verified
- ✅ Edge cases and failure scenarios comprehensively covered

### 2. **Production-Grade Error Handling**
- ✅ Exception handling with proper rollback testing
- ✅ Resource cleanup under all failure conditions validated
- ✅ Circuit breaker state management across failures tested
- ✅ Timeout scenarios with emergency recovery validated

### 3. **Performance & Scalability Testing**
