typescript blocks scattered throughout. The `edited` snippet provides a cleaned version of the code. I need to replace the entire content of the original file with the `edited` snippet to fix the errors.

```typescript
import { Pool, neonConfig } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/neon-serverless';
import ws from "ws";
import * as schema from "@shared/schema";

neonConfig.webSocketConstructor = ws;

if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
  throw new Error(
    "DATABASE_URL must be set. Did you forget to provision a database?",
  );
}

export const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
export const db = drizzle({ client: pool, schema });
